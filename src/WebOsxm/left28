  Tim Berners-Lee, Marc Andreessen, Vinton Cerf, Robert Kahn, and Louis Pouzin Awarded 2013 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering 
  18 March 2013
 The Royal Academy of Engineering announced today that Tim Berners-Lee, 
Marc Andreessen,
Vinton Cerf, Robert Kahn, and Louis Pouzin are
the recipients of the new Queen
Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, which recognizes "outstanding
Web, Andreessen for his work on the Mosaic browser, and Pouzin, Cerf, and Kahn for their pioneering work on fundamental Internet protocols.
"The prize recognises what has been a roller-coaster ride of wonderful international collaboration," said Berners-Lee. "Bob and Vint&#x2019;s work on building the internet was re-enforced by Louis&#x2019; work on datagrams and that enabled me to invent the Web. Marc&#x2019;s determined and perceptive work built on these platforms a product which became widely deployed across nations and computing platforms. I am honoured to receive this accolade and humbled to share it with them. I want the Web to inspire and empower new generations of engineers --boys and, especially, girls-- who will build, in turn, their own platforms, to improve our global society. I hope the message behind this award, along with the work we are doing with the World Wide Web Foundation and W3C, will assist in achieving the vision of a web that is open, accessible and of value to all."
