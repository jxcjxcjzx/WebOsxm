  HTML5 Definition Complete, W3C Moves to Interoperability Testing and Performance 
  17 December 2012
  | Archive
 W3C published today the complete definition of the HTML5 and Canvas 2D specifications. Though not yet W3C standards, these specifications are now feature complete, meaning businesses and developers have a stable target for implementation and planning. "As of today, businesses know what they can rely on for HTML5 in the coming years, and what their customers will demand," said Jeff Jaffe, W3C CEO. HTML5 is the cornerstone of the Open Web Platform, a full programming environment for cross-platform applications with access to device capabilities; video and animations; graphics; style, typography, and other tools for digital publishing; extensive network capabilities; and more. Read the full press release and W3C Member testimonials.
To reduce browser fragmentation and extend implementations to the full range of tools that consume and produce HTML, W3C now embarks on the stage of W3C standardization devoted to interoperability and testing.
W3C is on schedule to finalize the
HTML5 standard in 2014. In parallel, the W3C community will continue its work on next generation HTML features, including extensions to complement built-in HTML5 accessibility, responsive images, and adaptive streaming.
The HTML Working Group also published first drafts of HTML 5.1, HTML Canvas 2D Context, Level 2, and main element, providing an early view of the next round of standardization. Learn more About HTML.
    Last Call: Simple Delivery Profile for Closed Captions (US)
    03 January 2013
  | Archive
      The Timed Text Working Group has published a Last Call Working Draft of Simple Delivery Profile for Closed Captions (US). This document, expected to become a Group Note, specifies the Simple Online Delivery Profile (US) of the Timed Text Markup Language (TTML). The primary goal of the profile is to establish a minimum level of interoperability between TTML10 and legacy caption formats employed in US markets, such as CEA608 and CEA708. Comments are welcome through 31 January. Learn more about the Video in the Web Activity.
    Last Call: CSS Text Decoration Module Level 3; Update to Cascading and Inheritance Level 3
    03 January 2013
  | Archive
      The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group published a Last Call Working Draft of CSS Text Decoration Module Level 3. This module contains the features of CSS relating to text decoration, such as underlines, text shadows, and emphasis marks. Comments are welcome through 31 January.
 The group also published today a draft of CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 3. One of the fundamental design principles of CSS is cascading, which allows several style sheets to influence the presentation of a document. When different declarations try to set a value for the same element/property combination, the conflicts must somehow be resolved. The rules for finding the specified value for all properties on all elements in the document are described in this specification. Learn more about the Style Activity.
    High Resolution Time, and Navigation Timing are W3C Recommendations
    17 December 2012
  | Archive
      The Web Performance Working Group has published two W3C Recommendations today.
Navigation Timing. This specification defines an interface for web applications to access timing information related to navigation and elements.
High Resolution Time. This specification defines a JavaScript interface that provides the current time in sub-millisecond resolution and such that it is not subject to system clock skew or adjustments.
