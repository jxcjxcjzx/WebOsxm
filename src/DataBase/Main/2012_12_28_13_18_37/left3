"French Leave"

They sit on the rug,
So cozy and snug,
The cat and the dog together;
The snow may fall fast
And loud be the blast,

When here they may snooze
And do as they choose
In front of the embers ruddy;
'Tis Christmas today,
The master's away,






It's BACK!





A WRITER'S YEAR 2013! If you keep wondering where your time goes, here's a tool that can help.  A Writer's Year is a 365-day planner designed for writers -- not, like most of those expensive planners on the market, for folks who work 8-5.  Use it to plan your schedule, organize your tasks, record your achievements, track your goals and progress, and keep track of important deadlines.  Each week opens with a place to list your priorities and upcoming deadlines, and ends with an inspirational quote about writing.  Each day, there's space to make note of your achievements, tasks completed, and progress.
And, once again, it's FREE!  You can download the planner in PDF or Excel format, along with a submission tracker. Or, get a spiral-bound hardcopy from Lulu.com.
Just right-click one of the links below to get your copy.

Awesome Blogs
Write Now: The Writing Skills Blog

One look at the list of topics in the right column of this blog will tell you that you could spend a lot of time here and never get bored!  With topics including such diverse subjects as advertising, conferences, grammar, jargon, language abuse, social media, pitches and proposals, plain English, style, and writing for the media, I was curious to see what actually might fall into "uncategorized."  Answer: An excellent piece on why it is, in fact, OK to end a sentence with a preposition.  (Well, frankly, I think I'd have put that under "grammar.")  The blog is also packed with entertaining quizzes.  The only problem, for our American readers, is that this is a British site and focuses on correct British grammar and spellings, which are not, alas, always "correct" on the US side of the pond.
