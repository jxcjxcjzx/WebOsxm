Power of Partnerships: Working with our Neighbors to Build Strong Communities
For a century and a quarter USC has been a university in the city and of the city. Having grown, and grown up, with Los Angeles, USC draws its unique vigor from our surrounding communities. They're our pulse and lifeblood.
We continue to join with our neighbors to ensure that our streets are safe, our children are healthy and well educated, and our local businesses, the arts, and our extraordinary cultural institutions thrive.
We invite you to browse this site, and discover for yourself the power of USC's partnerships with our neighboring communities.
