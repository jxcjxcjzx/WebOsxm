  HTML5 Definition Complete, W3C Moves to Interoperability Testing and Performance 

  17 December 2012
  | Archive


 
    


 W3C published today the complete definition of the HTML5 and Canvas 2D specifications. Though not yet W3C standards, these specifications are now feature complete, meaning businesses and developers have a stable target for implementation and planning. "As of today, businesses know what they can rely on for HTML5 in the coming years, and what their customers will demand," said Jeff Jaffe, W3C CEO. HTML5 is the cornerstone of the Open Web Platform, a full programming environment for cross-platform applications with access to device capabilities; video and animations; graphics; style, typography, and other tools for digital publishing; extensive network capabilities; and more. Read the full press release and W3C Member testimonials.
To reduce browser fragmentation and extend implementations to the full range of tools that consume and produce HTML, W3C now embarks on the stage of W3C standardization devoted to interoperability and testing.
W3C is on schedule to finalize the
HTML5 standard in 2014. In parallel, the W3C community will continue its work on next generation HTML features, including extensions to complement built-in HTML5 accessibility, responsive images, and adaptive streaming.
The HTML Working Group also published first drafts of HTML 5.1, HTML Canvas 2D Context, Level 2, and main element, providing an early view of the next round of standardization. Learn more About HTML.

      The Web Performance Working Group has published two W3C Recommendations today.

Navigation Timing. This specification defines an interface for web applications to access timing information related to navigation and elements.
High Resolution Time. This specification defines a JavaScript interface that provides the current time in sub-millisecond resolution and such that it is not subject to system clock skew or adjustments.

Comments are welcome through 1 February 2013. Read the Role Attribute Proposed Recommendation e-mail announcement for more information, and about the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).
    


   
    Call for Review: Selectors API Level 1 Proposed Recommendation Published
    13 December 2012
  | Archive
    

    
      The Web Applications Working Group has published a Proposed Recommendation of Selectors API Level 1. Selectors, which are widely used in CSS, are patterns that match against elements in a tree structure. The Selectors API specification defines methods for retrieving Element nodes from the DOM by matching against a group of selectors. It is often desirable to perform DOM operations on a specific set of elements in a document. These methods simplify the process of acquiring specific elements, especially compared with the more verbose techniques defined and used in the past. Comments are welcome through 25 January.

    Last Call: CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 3
    13 December 2012
  | Archive
    

    
      The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group has published a Last Call Working Draft of CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 3. This module contains the features of CSS for conditional processing of parts of style sheets, conditioned on capabilities of the processor or the document the style sheet is being applied to. It includes and extends the functionality of CSS level 2, which builds on CSS level 1. The main extensions compared to level 2 are allowing nesting of certain at-rules inside &#x2018;@media&#x2019;, and the addition of the &#x2018;@supports&#x2019; rule for conditional processing. Comments are welcome through 10 January. Learn more about the Style Activity.
