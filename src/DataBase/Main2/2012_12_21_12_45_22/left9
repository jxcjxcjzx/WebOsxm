		Announcing Processing.js 1.0!
		Our sister project Processing.js has released its 1.0 version. As they explain, "Processing.js makes your data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language, include it in your web page, and Processing.js does the rest. It's not magic, but almost." They wrote a quick start guide for you.
		The image above is from ABSTRACT01js by Marius Watz.
