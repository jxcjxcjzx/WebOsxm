  Beihang University Becomes Newest Institution to Host W3C and Invites China to Assume Greater Role in Global Web Innovation 
  20 January 2013
  | Archive
    W3C announces Beihang University as a new center for W3C technical staff and leadership activities in China. W3C anticipates that a dedicated presence in China will enhance opportunities for collaboration among Chinese companies, Web developers, and research institutes, and W3C's full international community, including Members from more than 40 countries. "This is an important step of the internationalization strategy of Beihang University, creating a platform to help Chinese industry participate in the Web standards ecosystem," said Professor Jinpeng Huai, President of Beihang University. China has the world's second largest economy, the largest internet user population of any country with (560 million and growing rapidly), a large Web developer community, and growing involvement in international standards bodies. "In the past two years W3C has benefited from greater Chinese participation," said Jeff Jaffe, W3C CEO. "We look forward to that trend accelerating through the efforts of local industry and Beihang University. Global participation in W3C enables our community to identify global needs for the Web, and drive solutions." Read the press release and testimonials from W3C Members and other organizations, and the blog post from Jeff Jaffe.

    W3C Webinar: Developing Portable Mobile Applications with Compelling User Experience using the W3C MMI Architecture
    18 January 2013
  | Archive
      The W3C Multimodal Interaction (MMI) Working Group is pleased to announce the first webinar on &#x201C;Developing Portable Mobile Applications with Compelling User Experience using the W3C MMI Architecture&#x201D;, to be held on January 31, 2013, at 11:00 a.m. ET. The 90-minute webinar, the first in a series, is aimed at Web developers who may find it daunting to incorporate innovative input and output methods such as speech, touch, gesture and swipe into their applications, given the diversity of mobile devices and programming techniques available today. The topic will interest anyone who wants to take advantage of the dramatic increase in new interaction modes, whether for health care, financial services, broadcasting, automotive, gaming, or consumer devices.
Several experts from the industry and analyst communities will share their experiences and views on the explosive growth of opportunities for the development of applications that provide enhanced multimodal user-experiences. Read more and register for the webinar. Learn more about Multimodal Interaction at W3C.
    WebDriver Draft Published
    17 January 2013
  | Archive
      The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group has published a Working Draft of WebDriver. This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behavior of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a (possibly separate) browser. The WebDriver API is defined by a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behavior of the containing browser. This specification also includes a non-normative reference serialization (to JSON) of the interface's invocations and responses that may be useful for browser vendors. Learn more about the Web Testing Activity.
