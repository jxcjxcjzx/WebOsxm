Syntax

DHTMLX Touch framework offers intuitive object inheritance. You can define an object with properties, some of which are objects or arrays of objects, and some are simple strings or numbers. This way you can pass data into components or nest components one into another.


dhx.ui (
  {view:"toolbar", id:"mytoolbar", cols:[
  {view:"label", label:"TOUCH UI", align:"center"},
  {view:"button", width:100, label: 'Back', align:'right'}
]})
Extendable Functionality

DHTMLX Touch provides an elegant and simple solution to extend and customize the existing functionality of the library and to add new UI components. You can combine the existing component and functionality blocks with each other, or with custom code blocks, to create new components, or extend the existing ones.

Data Storage on the Client Side

Global data storage is an advanced and useful feature that allows keeping relations between data elements (e.g. list of employees and employee details form) on the client side.

This feature provides automatical update of data across UI elements without user intersection. For example, user changes an employee name in the details form and gets this name updated in the list of employees automatically.

Server-Side Support

Server side of DHTMLX Touch framework is based on dhtmlxConnectors (the same that used for DHTMLX Ajax library). You can also write your own server-side code. Communication between client and server is built on XML/JSON packages.

Development Tools

Visual Designer - an online tool that allows you to build mobile
web apps through a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface. Since v.1.2, you can save your design or share it by sending an URL. Watch the demo video or use it online.
Skin Builder - a simple online tool that provides an easy way
to choose the skin for you app and customize the skin colors. A set of predefined skins is included. Use online.
Touch UI Inspector - a free extension for Google Chrome
that provides a handy visual tool for monitoring the inner state of DHTMLX Touch JavaScript components on a web page. Visit on Chrome web store.

DHTMLX Touch Inside HTML Page

By default, top DHTMLX Touch component is added to document.body, but you also can put it within an HTML element as a container. It allows you to add elements to the page which was already created by using pure HTML.

HTML Inside DHTMLX Touch

If you're building your app with DHTMLX Touch, but still want to add HTML blocks in it, you can do it by using HTML element as a content of a template component:


<div id="flight_template">
  <i>html here with #placeholders#</i>
</div>
<script>
dhx.ui({
  rows:[
  {view:"template",
    template:"html->flight_template",
    url:"template_data.xml",
    datatype:"xml"},
  {view:"template", src:"content.php"}
]})
</script>
