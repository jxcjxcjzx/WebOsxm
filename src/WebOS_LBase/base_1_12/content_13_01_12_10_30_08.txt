The goal of /r/Games is to provide a place for informative and interesting gaming content and discussions.

Submissions should be for the purpose of informing or initiating a discussion, not just with the goal of entertaining viewers. Memes, comics, funny screenshots, direct links to web games, arts-and-crafts, etc. will be removed.

When submitting a link, the content submitted must be necessary, not just a "visual aid". For example, starting a discussion about a particular game would be a fine topic for a self-post, but should not be initiated by posting an image of its box-art.

Posts about any type of game (video, board, card, etc.) are allowed, but not sports.

 •
No "transaction" posts of any sort: giveaways, begging, trading, etc.

So this seems like a confirmation Valve are going VR for their hardware.

It will be interesting to see if they put full support to the Occulus or if they decide instead to go their own way and compete... they can of course afford to do so.

I don't think they'll compete, instead I think they're going to make new input devices to be used in unison with the Occulus. They've mentioned over and over again that the most underdeveloped and least progressed aspect of computing in the last 20-25 years was the mouse and keyboard, little has changed.

Even in the article he mentioned it, what is going to make VR really take off is new input methods that create a more immersive experience. While you can use a traditional control scheme in the short term it limits the potential of a true VR.

I think Half Life 3 is going to support the Occulus and either have some sort of launch deal with it and possibly some of their new input devices as well. Seems like a good marketing opportunity to get the market to transition.

Not confirmation. Certainly that they're interested in AR or VR. They've talked specifically about both before. They're researching it all, and talking about it. They've talked about wearable computing for quite awhile.

Valve working to further VR and AR is an amazing thing. This is really what we need as gamer's is support from such a high end company as Valve.
