Automatic Face Detection and Cropping

FaceCrop SDK offers developers a single-call access to fully automated detection, cropping, resizing, and exporting of images of human faces. No matter what size, format, or resolution the source picture is, and how large or small is the face in it, FaceCrop SDK will automatically locate and cut the face, saving the target picture in just the size and format you need.

Passport-like Photos from Ordinary Snapshots

In general, the use of FaceCrop SDK produces passport-like photos out of digital snapshots that contain human faces. Images taken with digital compact cameras, SLRs, and mobile phones and webcams are accepted as well as images scanned from analog media.

Supporting both PHP and ASP.NET, FaceCrop SDK can run on the server, taking digital images in a variety of sizes, formats, and resolutions, and returning uniform pictures of human faces.

High Image Quality

Images produced by FaceCrop SDK look smooth and professional no matter what quality the original was. The scaling employs advanced algorithms allowing the production of passport-size images while maintaining image clarity and legibility of facial features. Various custom aspect rates are supported. Even if the face is on the edge of the original image and does not fill the entire output rectangle, FaceCrop SDK will still produce a pleasing image.

FaceCrop SDK is available to developers writing in C++, Delphi, Visual Basic, C#, PHP, and ASP.NET. Output images can be exported into a file or returned as a HBITMAP value for further processing.
