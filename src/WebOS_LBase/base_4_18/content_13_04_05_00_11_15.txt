Thanks for downloading Qt!
You're about to evaluate Qt - the cross-platform application and UI framework used to develop world-leading applications such as Skype? Adobe Photoshop Elements, and Google Earth, as well as millions of embedded devices. 
GETTING STARTED
---------------
1. Choose either the standalone Qt evaluation, or the Qt SDK, or both!
2. Use the links below to download your evaluation
3. Install the evaluation package of your choice
4. Start using Qt!
GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR EVALUATION
-----------------------------------
1. Try the Qt Creator IDE and the Qt development tools.
2. Dive into the rich Qt documentation - You have full access to extensive Qt Commercial documentation and resources, available within the Qt Assistant tool included in your evaluation.
3. Explore the Qt community - You can get in touch with other Qt users via the Qt Project -- http://lists.qt-project.org/mailman/listinfo.
