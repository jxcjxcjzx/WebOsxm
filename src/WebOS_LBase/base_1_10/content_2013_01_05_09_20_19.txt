    A rational methodology for lossy compression - REWIC is a software-based implementation of a a rational system for progressive transmission which, in absence of a priori knowledge about regions of interest, choose at any truncation time among alternative trees for further transmission.
    To circumvent the lack of knowledge of what distortion measure is more suitable for optimization of the trade-off between image fidelity and coding rate, this coder shall introduce a novel mathematical methodology for rate control by organizing the progressive transmission in accordance with coherence constraints for avoiding forms of behavioral inconsistency. A set of postulates is provided for specifying the ways in which preferences need to be made precise and fit together if illogical forms of behavior are to be avoided. We show that the rational choice for transmission at truncation time t is to select bit streams which have the maximum expected increase in utility per coding bit, where ``rational'' must be understood in the sense that it cannot lead the transmission system into forms of behavioral inconsistency. This method is then used within a progressive transmission scheme to produce a new compression method called rational embedded wavelet image coding (REWIC). (by J.A.Garcia, Rosa Rodriguez-Sanchez, J.

    Collective rationality for the allocation of bits - CORAL is a software-based implementation of a new coder scheme that in absence of a priori knowledge about regions of interest propose a new method for bit allocation which can be used with reasonable internal consistency and acceptable image fidelity.
    The effectiveness of a coding method can be improved through a space-varying filterbank tree representation of the image, and this property can be conveniently exploited using appropriate bit allocation strategies among the spatial segments of the image. In CORAL we examine the conditions for achieving a rational agreement on the distribution problem by stating axioms that its solution must obey in absence of a priori knowledge about regions of interest. Firstly, a measure of benefit avoiding certain forms of behavioral inconsistency is to be assigned to each possible bit allocation in such a way that each region's preference may be inferred between any two bit allocations from their respective benefits. Secondly, individual regions are to agree on an allocation of bits which is then to be brought about by a joint strategy, but, under what conditions is their agreement rational? CORAL propose a characterization of rational agreement whose solution is an application of a general procedure for cooperative action where each may benefit only on terms which permit proportionately equal benefits to others. Experimental results are given to evaluate the performance of the strategy of COllective Rationality for the ALlocation of bits (CORAL), based upon a validated predictor for visual distinctness from digital imagery.

    Gandalf - Gandalf is a computer vision and numerical algorithm library, written in C, which allows you to develop new applications that will be portable and run FAST. Includes many useful vision routines, including camera calibration, homographies, fundamental matrix computation, and feature detectors (includes source code).
    Dynamically reconfigurable vector, matrix and image structures in Gandalf allow efficient use of memory. Gandalf has been used to develop the "MoKey" motion editing software, released at IBC'2001 in Amsterdam. MoKey performs automatic inpainting of moving objects over an image sequence, and can also be used to compute an accurate alpha matte or outline of an object. Gandalf currently contains four packages: 1) Common package of simple structures and routines used by the other packages, such as memory allocation, linked lists and error handling; 2) Linear algebra package with a large number of routines for matrix and vector manipulations; 3) Image package defining a general purpose image structure and low-level image manipulation routines; 4) Vision package containing a number of standard image processing, computer vision and numerical routines. The major design features of Gandalf are: (i) Efficient use of memory through dynamically reconfigurable structures; (ii) Emphasis on support of numerical algorithms, especially optimisation; (iii) A very flexible and efficient internal image representation, (iv) A comprehensive set of matrix/vector operations, incorporating implicit matrix transpose & inverse, and in-place computation where appropriate; Exploitation of the computational and compilation speed advantages of C over C++ in reducing the number of layers of abstraction over the raw data, an approach we believe is appropriate for simple objects such as matrices, vectors and images. The documentation for Gandalf comes in two parts. There is a LaTex tutorial with examples available also in HTML (via Latex2html). Reference documentation for Gandalf has also been generated using ObjectOutline, (by Philip McLauchlan / Imagineer Software Ltd)
    General Image Rectification - Re-usable free C++ source code library for performing general image rectification
    Rectification is the process of simplifying the epipolar geometry by making epipolar lines in a pair of images co-incident and parallel to the x axis. The code presented here is a free C++ library incl. source code for performing general image rectification given the fundamental or essential matrix. The method used is general and so will work for ANY valid epipolar geometry. The method also has the advantage over other methods of attempting to minimise image distortion caused by rectification and ensuring that disparities will be roughly centred on 0 pixels.

    Segmentation of Skin-Cancer Images - Implementation of an algorithm for segmenting images of skin cancer and other pigmented lesions (see Image and Vision Computing, January 1999, pp. 65-74).
    An automatic method for segmention of images of skin cancer and other pigmented lesions is implemented. This method first reduces a color image into an intensity image and approximately segments the image by intensity thresholding. Then, it refines the segmentation using image edges. Double thresholding is used to focus on an image area where a lesion boundary potentially exists. Image edges are then used to localize the boundary in that area. A closed elastic curve is fitted to the initial boundary and is locally shrunk or expanded to approximate edges in its neighborhood in the area of focus. Segmentation results from twenty randomly selected images show an average error that is about the same as that obtained by four experts manually segmenting the images. (by L. Xu, M. Jackowski, A.

    Texture Synthesis and Analysis by Rupert Paget - Fast texture synthesis by nonparametric MRF modelling. Source code is provided, plus many free textures.
    Fast Semi Causal Nonparametric Markov Random Field Texture Synthesis. This algorithm is a cut down version of the algorithm published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 1998. In this version, it has been rewritten for a single cpu machine. To maintain speed of synthesis, the update function UpdateFn() has been set to return the maximum value. If this was modified to return a portion of the maximum value, then the synthesis would take longer, but there would be a gain in quality. If you do decide to modify the code, be careful, as I have not put in any safeguard checks. Best to fully understand the whole code, before modifying it. Recently there has been quite an influx of nonparametric sampling techniques for texture synthesis, this is because it has been the nonparametric models that have had the greatest success at synthesising arbitrary textures. This technique uses a multiscale approach, which has the advantage that only a small neighbourhood is required. This fast version implements a modification based on Ashikhmin's Synthesizing Natural Textures. As noted in his work, the L2 norm may not be the best measure to test for perceptual similarity between two neighbourhoods. Instead, we may note that if we are only taking pixels from the input image (and not sampling from a larger distribution), then when we iterate a respective pixel, we can be assured that each of its defined neighbours occur within the input image. Speed can be gained if, instead of doing a exhaustive search, we only sample from those pixels which have the same neighbour. In this algorithm I have modified Ashikhmin's approach by using our previous algorithm, and sampling from all pixels which have at least one of its neighbours the same colour as its respective neighbour of the pixel being iterated. This algorithm works well for natural textures which have a pixelwise noise distribution.

    Image processing and analysis in Java - ImageJ is a public domain Java image processing program inspired by NIH Image for the Macintosh.
    It runs, either as an online applet or as a downloadable application, on any computer with a Java 1.1 or later virtual machine. Downloadable distributions are available for Windows, Mac OS, Mac OS X and Linux. It can display, edit, analyze, process, save and print 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit images. It can read many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, FITS and "raw". It supports "stacks", a series of images that share a single window. It is multithreaded, so time-consuming operations such as image file reading can be performed in parallel with other operations. It can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections. It can measure distances and angles. It can create density histograms and line profile plots. It supports standard image processing functions such as contrast manipulation, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection and median filtering. It does geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation and flips. Image can be zoomed up to 32:1 and down to 1:32. All analysis and processing functions are available at any magnification factor. The program supports any number of windows (images) simultaneously, limited only by available memory. Spatial calibration is available to provide real world dimensional measurements in units such as millimeters. Density or gray scale calibration is also available. ImageJ was designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins. Custom acquisition, analysis and processing plugins can be developed using ImageJ's built in editor and Java compiler. User-written plugins make it possible to solve almost any image processing or analysis problem. ImageJ is being developed on Mac OS X using its built in editor and Java compiler, plus the BBEdit editor and the Ant build tool. The source code is freely available.
