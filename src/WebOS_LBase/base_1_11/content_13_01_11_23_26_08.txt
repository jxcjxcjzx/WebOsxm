I say emotional infidelity is when you or your partner starts taking more personal matters away from the home and the other partner and sharing them with someone else. Say like for example you have a miscarriage, and you are hurting over it and would expect your husband to be there to console you as he grieves too. But instead he takes his hurt to some perky, female friend that will listen to his hurt and pain. Soothe him. Make him feel better. And that is when the door is open a really big emotional thing like that opens the door to a trusting foundation that he probably hasn't had with you for weeks. And over time as those feelings grow and get stronger so much so that he is protecting her from guys that may try to hit on her and more flirting happens. And before you know it that one hand on his thigh or a certain look and they are back at her place getting it on. That is emotional infidelity. Because the emotional bond between you and your husband is broken. There is no more confiding in each other, just two people sharing a house and paying bills.
 
Now not all emotional infidelity leads to physical cheating. But still when you or your partner can't be open and share things like you used to, a good portion of your relationship is gone. Pretty much leaving it deadened. So yes that is why this is adultry too and in my opinion the most hurtful kind of cheating there is. Some people may tell you physical is, but if you stop and think about it, to have true physical intimacy and a spiritual bond enough of our emotions need to tie us to our partner and them to us to even make intimacy exist or to even perform the physical expression of showing our love through love making. So without any emotional attachment as I mentioned above, you and your partner just be two being living routine without any real meaning behind it. Soon or later you drift apart and maybe even try to pass the blame off on each other for not trying hard enough in the relationship. And that may be true, but as I see it , it takes 2 to make anything work if we really want it to. Hopefully this helps you out.

Been here before



Think of a relationship between a husband and a wife. It's not just the sexual part of the relationship that makes it special. It's also the emotional intimacy. I think of emotional infidelity as anything that threatens the emotional intimacy of a couple. One party in a relationship going outside of that relationship for comfort and support on a consistent basis is emotional infidelity. 

Technically, this is not adultery. That means that you cannot cite adultery on divorce papers because of emotional infidelity. However, this generally the first step to adultery. Men who do not think they will ever cheat may find themselves falling into the trap of becoming too close emotionally with a female friend and, eventually taking that final step into adultery.

It's when you haven't acted on your feelings by actually having sex but you have definite feelings for someone else. It's more than just a physical attraction.

Emotional infedelity is a form of cheating. You're having a friendship with someone, sharing things with them and building an emotional connection with someone outside your marriage. Its not just friendship but something deeper.

It's having emotional "feelings" for someone else! It's not adultery.

It's one of the 10 Commandments, "Thou shalt not covet they neighbors wife." Which means you shouldn't be lusting after someone else's wife OR husband for that matter. To covet, is to want something you can't have.

When you cling to someone else other than your spouse you commit emotional infidelity. You are being untrue by placing someone other than your spouse at the top of your list. The person can be a counselor or friend or even a family member. Adultery is a physical act of sex committed between two people where at least one of them is married. Thinking is not the same as acting on our desires but it can lead someone to the act if they think about it all the time.

It is basically when a person communicates his/her feelings with someone else other than their partner. By feelings, I am speaking of the inner most ones concerning how their partner does not know how to treat them or make them feel loved or what they are missing at least from their point-of-view and then conveying these to someone else that seems like what they are looking for. It is more than a friendship as it actually becomes a link to that person and can lead to more adulterous infidelities occurring. These are dangerous and are often mis-directed.
 
By many counselor's definition, YES, it is a form of adultery because the person generally stops communicating with their partner and looks toward the other to share with, to just be in their presence makes them feel better. Their attitude changes when they must leave the other and return to their partner. The home is basically cold and, try as they may to cover it up, the change is noticeable. A person who is emotionally or physically cheating can not hide it...it will show.
 
Communicate with your partner about everything you feel and don't go looking for someone else to be that ear or fall for the lines they will feed you to try and hook you. If you are not interested in your relationship, then just end it. Don't play the game because in the end things will only get worse and the recovery will be a long hellish road to travel and what you had before can never be regained.
