Whether democrat or socialist, this is a reddit for those on the left side of the aisle.

Because, as the great conservative pundit Stephen Colbert says... "Reality has a well-known liberal bias"

"What is perhaps most revealing about looking at Japan’s gun laws, and seeing what makes them the most extreme gun restrictions in the developed world, is that it gives you a sense, for better or worse, of what American gun laws look like to everyone else." - Washington Post (washingtonpost.com)

But the catch is, do you want the police in America to have as many Carte Blanche powers as the Japanese Police do...?

Yep, extended search and seizure powers. Air rifles treated like guns(No Red Ryder BB gun for you, Ralphie), No swords whatsoever.

after getting bombed to bejeezus in World War 2, they're populace did something collectively which has really been seen in human history: they went pacifist as a nation. there is even a famous incident in the 19 seventies where a General and a few of his most loyal officers attempted to restore the monarchies power and the Bushido code. when the people heard of this, they rushed his building and protested.

that General and his first officer ended up committing seppuku.

The Japanese constitution was written by the conquering western occupiers after ww2. Strict firearms laws were written to lessen the ability of the occupied people to organise a revolt against the puppet regimes.

What about the ability to hold you up to 23 days w/o charge, restricting your access to council, and questionable interrogation techniques. 

Frankly, I could understand restricted Conceal Carry, but I should be allowed to keep long-arms and handguns at home for target shooting, and self-defense. But in my case, primarily target shooting. Although, if I ever get an AR-15 variant (impossible in NYC) , its more for the "rule of cool" factor. :P

That's actually exactly what the article discusses... the trade off between safety and civil liberties.

Yea, I realize that. But would YOU, want that (my question to you guys).

[–]gwarster[S] 4 分/分 26 天 ago




Actually I think I would probably prefer it. I would rather have accountable public servants with more power than just letting any random (potentially insane) person buy extended clip handguns.

That is of course assuming that the police would need that level of power to enforce the gun laws. Personally, I think there could be an even medium of outlawing guns except for shotguns and hunting rifles, but keeping the search and seizure laws the same. Current gun owners could keep their weapons with a grandfather clause or turn them in to the local police station for a market value equivilent payment.

I think the British classifications ain't that bad. Few restrictions on Bolt- Actions/Pump Actions. So if all of you guys want to own Lee Enfields, go know yourself out. But they are much stricter with semis. 

So in the US, I guess to make concealable weapons harder to get. Like NYC's handgun laws (w. the exception of the mag limit, the law should make the default mag sizes for ea. handgun the limit Cause gawd does it feel wrong to have a Glock, but only 10rds in the mag). 

Guess my OCD is flaring up again. :P

That's not a bad policy. If gun takes long enough to reload after each shot so that the shooter could be tackled, I don't think it should be illegal or particularly difficult to obtain. Its when we get into glocks with 30 bullet clips that I start to wonder.

The problem America has is that due to the "as-is" situation, looking to other countries laws really isn't so useful. Many of the weapons people want to ban are already in circulation, gun ownership is so high and guns are an ingrained part of the culture.

Of course, all you have to do is say "Yakuza" and the Japanese police will leave you alone.

My mom and dad wen't to Japan on a business trip about ten years ago, and a Japanese guy asked them "So do all Americans carry guns?" Since the Japanese are exceedingly polite in business transactions, he was actually curious and not being sarcastic.

I'm not giving up my gun without spilling blood. I'm also a hard left social-democrat and atheist, not a paranoid southern conservative (before you jump to conclusions.) There is no reason that I shouldn't be able to own a gun. I've never been in a fist fight, I haven't even had so much as a speeding ticket. If it wasn't for the right to bear arms I'd have already attempted to immigrate to Norway.

Why would you kill someone over the ownership of a weapon? Is life less important than owning something you like?

[–]seppa_ilmarinen -1 分/分 25 天 ago




My freedom is. This is the sentiment that much of America has and that is why guns will never be banned.
 permalink

[–]Apparatii 1 分/分 25 天 ago




The fact that you're willing to end a life over your ownership of a gun makes you an idiot at best, and a monster at worst. 
permalink

[–]seppa_ilmarinen 1 分/分 25 天 ago




Well it doesn't really matter since it won't ever happen in America. There are too many guns and too many people that feel the same way I do.

Great, millions of people who'd rather play John Galt and kill people then give up a stupid toy for grown ups. I feel safer already...

Before you try to mock me for not growing up somewhere where guns are common, don't bother. I shoot guns (targets only). I'm an Eagle Scout. I'm an outdoorsman. My objection is this literally insane idea that losing a Gun is worth killing fellow human beings over. If the government banned televisions I wouldn't start bludgeoning people to death with them in some idiotic display of "freedom."

I'm not attempting to mock you for not understanding guns or something silly, I want to know if you live in a safe area? I live in northern Minnesota, the iron range, and didn't feel the need to carry a gun. I travel for work though and now that I've seen the south I understand why guns are such a big issue. I'd never had to worry about walking down the street before.

[–]Apparatii 2 分/分 25 天 ago




I understand that, and I don't mind people owning weapons. I simply could never consider killing someone in the vain attempt to keep one. 

EDIT: And I live in upstate NY. My town is calm, but some of the neighboring cities have comparatively high crime rates. Still never had to resort to carrying a gun though.
