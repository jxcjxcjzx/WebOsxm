Jason Andrew for the Wall Street Journal
Reshma Saujani started up “Girls Who Code” after an unsuccessful run for U.S. Congress in 2010, when she was struck by tech inequalities.A shortage of female workers in science and engineering has long posed an image problem for Silicon Valley. Now a one-time congressional candidate is trying to make a difference, starting with a summer training program in New York City.

A new organization called Girls who Code is starting an eight-week program in July for 20 high-school-age girls, who will learn how to build websites and mobile apps and start their own companies. There will also be workshops on topics such a  financial literacy, computer science and robotics. The group said it has financial backing from companies including Google, eBay, General Electric and Twitter.

Reshma Saujani, founder of Girls Who Code and a former deputy public advocate in New York City, said the seeds for the program were planted during her unsuccessful 2010 run for U.S. Congress, when she was struck by tech inequalities.

She said in her New York Congressional district’s wealthier neighborhoods, such as Manhattan’s Upper East Side, schools would have up-to-date tech equipment and robotics labs, and in less affluent areas, children would have access to “one computer in the basement of a church,” Saujani said.

“Women are going to be left behind,” Saujani said. “Technology has the potential to create
income inequity and we need to do something about it.”

Cries of “where are all the women?” reverberate from Wall Street to politics and beyond, but the dearth of women is particularly stark in technology fields, where talent is held up as the quality that trumps historic barriers of sex, race or class. Despite many programs aimed at encouraging women in tech fields, fewer than 20% of undergraduate degrees in engineering or computing and information sciences were awarded to women in 2009, according to the National Center for Women & Information Technology. A fraction of start-ups are led by or founded by women.

Girls Who Code and other initiatives aimed at drawing more women to tech fields say the key is to get girls interested in science, engineering and computing when they are very young, and support them to pursue education in technology.

“If we want there to be more women who pursue careers in engineering and computer science and feel welcome in these fields, we have to work on ways to increase the number of women studying engineering — it’s that simple,” wrote Sara Haider, a Twitter engineer, in a blog post Tuesday.

Girls Who Code has the advantage of a high-profile founder, Saujani, the onetime hedge-fund attorney and former campaign fundraiser for Hillary Clinton before her Congressional run. Saujani drew a spotlight during her campaign, which had the backing of tech and Wall Street luminaries such as Morgan Stanley’s then-chairman John Mack and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. After a rough-and-tumble campaign, Saujani lost the Democratic primary to the incumbent, Rep. Carolyn Maloney.

Saujani and Kristen Titus, executive director of Girls Who Code, said they focused on drawing participants from less affluent families. Saujani said she went to New York City public housing developments and asked tenants to identify girls who are excited about computers. Saujani said 70% of New York City public school students have had no access to computers in school.

In addition to the eight weeks of workshops, participants in Girls Who Code also will be paired with female mentors in engineering roles at AppNexus, an advertising technology firm in New York, and other women entrepreneurs in New York City.

Girls Who Code said it hopes to expand the program to other cities next year.

.For students in underserved communities high school is too late because their peers and counterparts will have been introduced to the same technology at a much earlier age and have a “head start”. While it is never “technically” too late to learn a new skill to really change the equation of women and diverse populations in the tech field it is imperative to introduce technology as soon as possible. Especially for girls who tend to make career choices and life path decisions starting around middle school.

.@Kevin:

That’s not true at all! Throughout high school I took mainly arts subjects like history and music. Now I’m in my honours year of a computer science degree and I have a job lined up when I graduate at the end of this year. I admit that it would’ve made things a bit easier had I studied more maths at school but I’ve cherished the challenge nevertheless.

This is such an awesome initiative btw! I wish they had things like this is New Zealand

.It is never too late to get women interested in computer science and engineering. I went back to school in my late 40′s and got a masters’ in computer science and software engineering at 49! It was not easy but with maturity and lots of determination, I graduated and earned a membership to the computing machinery honors society. I always wanted to be an engineer and now I am.
If you want something, go and get it!
