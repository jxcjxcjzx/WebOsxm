Affiliate Marketing
 
Affiliate Marketing  is a channel that has driven billions of dollars in sales for online retailers. Over time it has become an integral part of marketing plans and a useful tool for specific marketing and sales objectives including increasing general sales, moving select inventory, and helping new brands get established.
 
Effective Affiliate Marketing relies on two groups, the Publishers (affiliates) who display advertisements online and the Advertisers (merchants) who aim to increase sales for their online shop.
