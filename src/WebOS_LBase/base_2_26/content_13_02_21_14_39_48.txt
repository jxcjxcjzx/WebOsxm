Introduction

This guide describes the Foundation framework classes available for interacting with URLs and communicating with servers using standard Internet protocols. Together these classes are referred to as the URL loading system.

The NSURL class provides the ability to manipulate URLs and the resources they refer to.

The Foundation framework also provides a rich collection of classes that include support for URL loading, cookie storage, response caching, credential storage and authentication, and writing custom protocol extensions.

The URL loading system provides support for accessing resources using the following protocols:
•
File Transfer Protocol (ftp://)

•
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http://)

•
Secure 128-bit Hypertext Transfer Protocol (https://)

•
Local file URLs (file:///)


It also transparently supports both proxy servers and SOCKS gateways using the user’s system preferences.
