webOS Service APIs
This section documents APIs for interacting with webOS services.

Developer options for accessing services

You can open a shell on a device through putty and use luna-send to test out accessing services at the command-line.
JavaScript apps and services can use the Foundations library's PalmCall.
Tools for testing services

luna-send - A good way to learn service API syntax and experiment; after, you can write the code to do what you already did at the command line.
ls-monitor - Lets you see traffic going over the webOS service bus, similar to a network sniffer that lets you observe HTTP traffic.
