Tutorial Introduction








Spanish | French | Russian | Italian | Greek | Hungarian | Japanese

So you have just started vvvv for the first time and wonder how to proceed in learning, how to achieve some useful things with it. Take your time and read on. Within 20 minutes you should be through the first tutorial and have a basic understanding of vvvv. 

Ready. Set. Go.
 
When you started vvvv out of the box it has automatically opened a sample to show off a bit. If you are already impressed by it and want to get rid of it just delete the file Args.txt in vvvv's program folder. Now close vvvv by pressing the windows standard shortcut for closing programms: ALT+F4. Now you'll be asked to save some files. Just click Don't save and Close for now. 

Start vvvv again and the sample has disappeared. All you see is a virgin gray window, a so called Patch. Welcome to vvvv.

Preface
 
vvvv uses graphical objects for programming instead of a textual programming interface. Programs are created within patches. Individual operations or functions are represented as nodes. Connections between are called links and are drawn and modified with the mouse, creating a structure that sends data from one node to another.
 



Basically a node either generates, processes or outputs data. Some nodes even do a combination of those three operations. Every node can have several inputs and outputs which are represented by small black squares on its top and bottom which are called pins or inlets and outlets.
 
In comparison to a textual programming language the input pins would represent the parameters/arguments of a function whereas the output pins would mean the result of that function.
 
That much about the theory. Now let's go retro and say Hello World! with the second tutorial.
