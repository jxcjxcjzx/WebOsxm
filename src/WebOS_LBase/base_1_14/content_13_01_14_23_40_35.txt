Tesseract is a free software optical character recognition engine for various operating systems.[2]
 
Originally developed as proprietary software at Hewlett-Packard between 1985 and 1995, it had very little work done on it in the following decade. It was then released as open source in 2005 by Hewlett Packard and UNLV. Tesseract development has been sponsored by Google since 2006.[3] It is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.[1][4][5]
 
Tesseract is considered one of the most accurate free software OCR engines currently available.[5][6]

[edit] History
 
The Tesseract engine was developed at Hewlett Packard Laboratories Bristol and at Hewlett Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some migration from C to C++ in 1998. A lot of the code was written in C, and then some more was written in C++. Since then all the code has been converted to at least compile with a C++ compiler.[4]
 
[edit] Features
 
Tesseract was in the top 3 OCR engines in terms of character accuracy in 1995. It is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, however, due to limited resources only Windows and Ubuntu are rigorously tested by developers.[4][5][7]
 
Tesseract up to and including version 2 could only accept TIFF images of simple one column text as inputs. These early versions did not include layout analysis and so inputting multi-columned text, images, or equations produced a garbled output. Since version 3.00 Tesseract has supported output text formatting, hOCR positional information and page layout analysis. Support for a number of new image formats was added using the Leptonica library. Tesseract can detect whether text is monospaced or proportional.[5]
 
The initial versions of Tesseract could only recognize English language text. Starting with version 2 Tesseract was able to process English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and Dutch. Starting with version 3 it can recognize Arabic, English, Bulgarian, Catalan, Czech, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Danish, German (standard and Fraktur script), Greek, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Croatian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak (standard and Fraktur script), Slovenian, Spanish, Serbian, Swedish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese. Tesseract can be trained to work in other languages too.[5]
 
If Tesseract is used to process right-to-left text such Arabic or Hebrew the results are ordered as though it is left-to-right text.[8]
 
Tesseract is suitable for use as a backend, and can be used for more complicated OCR tasks including layout analysis by using a frontend such as OCRopus.[9]
 
[edit] User interfaces
 




Tesseract configuration window in OCRFeeder 
Tesseract does not come with a GUI and is instead run from the command-line interface.[10]
 
There are several separate projects which provide a GUI for Tesseract:
 FreeOCR – a Windows Tesseract GUI[11]
 gImageReader – GTK GUI frontend for Tesseract that supports selecting columns and parts of the document. It can open multipage PDF files or images, supports all formats, can transmit a selected area to Tesseract for recognition and spell check the output.[12]
 gscan2pdf – A GUI to produce PDFs or DjVus from scanned documents[13]
 OCRFeeder – Features a complete GTK graphical user interface that allows the users to correct any unrecognized characters, defined or correct bounding boxes, set paragraph styles, clean the input images, import PDFs, save and load the project, export everything to multiple formats, etc.[14]
 OcrGui – A Linux GUI, written in C language using the GLib and GTK+ frameworks, it supports both Tesseract and GOCR. It includes spell checking using Hunspell, an open source spell checker.[15]
 Qiqqa – A freeware PDF reference management tool that uses Tesseract to interpret scanned PDFs for full-index searching.[16]
 Tesseract GUI – A Mac OS X free software GUI[17]
 TextRipper – a Linux Tesseract and/or Ocrad GUI with multiple -page, -column, and -file selection support.[18]
 VietOCR – A Java-based cross-platform GUI that includes a language pack for Vietnamese and special post-processing tools for Vietnamese[19]
 YAGF – Graphical front-end (Qt 4.x) for cuneiform and tesseract for Linux[20]
 
[edit] Libraries using Tesseract engine
 ABCocr .NET - an OCR component for Microsoft's .NET Framework, with support for 64-bit systems, built around a custom version of the Tesseract 3 engine.[21]
 hOcr2Pdf.NET – a .NET library to convert Tesseract recognized images into PDF with search capabilities using HtmlAgilityPack and iTextSharp.[22]
 
[edit] Reception
 
In a July 2007 article on Tesseract, Anthony Kay of Linux Journal termed it "a quirky command-line tool that does an outstanding job". At that time he noted "Tesseract is a bare-bones OCR engine. The build process is a little quirky, and the engine needs some additional features (such as layout detection), but the core feature, text recognition, is drastically better than anything else I've tried from the Open Source community. It is reasonably easy to get excellent recognition rates using nothing more than a scanner and some image tools, such as The GIMP and Netpbm."[2]
