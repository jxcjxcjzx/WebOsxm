 title : The TMXResourceBundle - TMX Java Bridge Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TMXResourceBundle is an extension of Java ResourceBundle class to read text resources directly from a TMX file.</p>

<p>TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) is the vendor-neutral open XML standard for the exchange of Translation Memory (TM) data created by Computer Aided Translation (CAT) and localization tools. The purpose of TMX is to allow easier exchange of translation memory data between tools and/or translation vendors with little or no loss of critical data during the process. In existence since 1998, TMX is a certifiable standard format. TMX is developed and maintained by OSCAR (Open Standards for Container/Content Allowing Re-use), a LISA (Localization Industry Standards Association) Special Interest Group.
<br/>One of the main concerns of internationalization consists of separating the main source code from the texts, the labels, the messages and all the other objects related to the specific language in use. This facilitates the translation process as such as all the resources related to the local language context are well identified and separated.</p>

<p>Since version JDK 1.1, Java provides great support for internationalization (i18n) by offering several instruments and tools, for example the support to Unicode 2.0, the multilingual environments and the object localization, just to mention a few.
<br/>However, all these instruments may not be sufficient when we target a global market in which the costs to translate and update the texts (including labels, messages, menu elements and so on) can easily become quite high.
<br/>This is the context where the TMX standard comes to help by applying to the translation and management process of these texts the concepts of reuse, increase of consistency, and the shortening of the production cycle. All this with the added bonus of cutting the development costs.</p>

 title : The Tidydoc Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The goal of Tidydoc is to make documentation organization easier. It addresses the following problems:
<br/>You can add documents using the web interface or any file transfer program, such as scp. Tidydoc can then generate HTML files indexing your documents. A simple description file is required for each document. No additional tool is required, a standard Unix system (or Windows/Cygwin) with a Python interpreter will do the job.
<br/>Every operation can be done through a web interface if you are running a web server (e.g. Apache) or using the embedded, lightweight web server.
<br/>Tidydoc is written in Python in a spirit of flexibility and easy tweaking, but its default behavior should fit the needs of most people.
<br/>The latest version is 0.6.
<br/>You can download it here: http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/tidydoc/tidydoc-0.6.tar.gz

<br/>				 Introduction to Xiang Qi
<br/>				Xiang Qi (pronounced loosely as: zang che) is THE most played board game in the
<br/>				world. Go anywhere in the orient and you will find this game being played in
<br/>				homes, on trains, cafes, even on the sidewalks of downtown Beijing, China. 
<br/>				Elephant chess is similar to International Chess, with a few
<br/>				  interesting twists. To play, drag a red piece to a valid move location. Valid
<br/>				  moves can be found by moving the mouse over the pieces. The object is to
<br/>				  capture the King, located at the top center of the board. Be careful, the
<br/>				  computer is a fair player and you must protect your own King!  
<br/>				 The Pieces
<br/>				   King (also called General) Move vertically and
<br/>				horizontally inside the palace. A king can not be moved horizontally into a
<br/>				column that has a free line of sight of the other king. You can use this rule
<br/>				to your advantage to limit the moves of your opponent. 
<br/>				Guard  
<br/>				Guards move diagonally. The guard lives inside the palace with
<br/>				  the king. Elephant  
<br/>				Moves at an angle two steps. Similar to a Horse, but with a
<br/>				  bigger step. Can be blocked by a piece that occupies the first of the two
<br/>				  steps.The piece can move from the position A.I, C.G, I.A, G.C only when there
<br/>				  is no piece on the position E. The elephant can NOT cross the river (perhaps it
<br/>				  will drown?). A-B-C | | | D-E-F
<br/>				  | | | G-H-I  
<br/>				Horse (Knight)  
<br/>				The piece can move from position A to the position F only when
<br/>				  there is no piece on the position C. Piece can move in any direction in the
<br/>				  same manner(E to B, B to E, F to A, A to F). The horse, unlike the elephant,
<br/>				  can across the river. The horse is used just like the knight in European
<br/>				  chess,and is one of the most important pieces.  
<br/>				A-B | | C-D | |
<br/>				  E-F  
<br/>				Cart (Rook)  
<br/>				Same as a rook in European chess. Cannon  
<br/>				The Cannon is the most bizarre piece in Xiang Qi. The cannon
<br/>				  moves like a cart, but can only capture by jumping one piece. The jumped piece
<br/>				  can be either color and there are no restrictions on the length of the jump.
<br/>				  Only one piece can be jumped and there must be a piece to capture. Soldier (Pawn)  
<br/>				The soldier is similar to a pawn in European chess, with a
<br/>				  couple of twists. First, the piece moves from home to enemy territory in a
<br/>				  straight line. If there is a piece in front of the soldier, it can capture it.
<br/>				  After the soldier crosses the river, it may move and capture horizontal. Note:
<br/>				  the soldier cannot retreat. The soldier can never backup.    
<br/>				   
<br/>				 Other Rules 
<br/>				 Queening of Pawns There is no equivalent of queening of a
<br/>				pawn. All pieces remain the same throughout the game. However, the pawn does
<br/>				gain left and right motion when it crosses the river. 
<br/>				 Castling No equivalent in Xiang Qi. 
<br/>				 King Line of Sight The kings cannot be allowed to face
<br/>				each other. That means that if the kings are on the same column, the last piece
<br/>				between them cannot be moved (it can be captured). Also, a king cannot move
<br/>				into a column that does not have pieces between the it and the enemy king. If
<br/>				the king is in check and the only move is into the line of sight, the game is
<br/>				checkmate. 
<br/>				 Regret Regret is an odd thing in Xiang Qi. In almost all
<br/>				but official games and especially when a novice and a master are playing,
<br/>				regret is a mutual acknowledgement that one of the players really goofed. The
<br/>				pieces are returned to the point where the mistake was made. 
<br/>				 Kibitzing Unlike traditional chess, Xiang Qi is a
<br/>				spectator sport. The reason is mainly because a lot of games are played for
<br/>				money with side bets held by the crowd. Spectators, with money at stake, are
<br/>				apt to call out moves or even reach into the game and move a piece.   
<br/>				 Other Stuff

<br/>				  master? Just head for the Xiang Qi Home
<br/>				  pages!

<br/>				Problems? Does your web browser crash? It has been known to
<br/>				  happen. Try again because sometimes browsers, like Netscape, need to start out
<br/>				  fresh because of fragmented memory. If that does not work, upgrade to the next
<br/>				  valid version of your browser. Be aware that Beta &amp; Alpha versions are not
<br/>				  guaranteed to work! If you are behind a firewall, this application will fail to
<br/>				  load. If you are still having problems, let me know.</p>

 title : The Hotswap with Ant Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Hotswap Task for Ant 1.6.x 
<br/>This jar file contains a hotswap target for Ant that allows your build file to replace class definitions on a running JVM.</p>

<p>This jar file should be put in the ant/lib directory. hotswap.jar It was compiled against the Ant 1.6.1 codebase.</p>

<p>This has been tested with j2sdk1.4.1_06, but should work with any 1.4 and greater JVM. It uses the JDI (Java Debug Interface) API.</p>

<p>The Hotswap target
<br/>Replaces classes on a running JVM. This task can take the following
<br/>arguments:</p>

<p>verbose - prints class names as they are being swapped
<br/>failonerror - causes task to exit if any error occurs
<br/>host - the host of the JVM to be attached to (defaults to localhost)
<br/>port - the port number to be used to attach to the JVM
<br/>name - if not using a socket connection, this name is the share memory label</p>

<p>Of these arguments, the host and port are required. Or,
<br/>the name can be used instead to indicate a shared mem connection.</p>

<p>See the JPDA documentation for details on the JVM runtime options.</p>

<p>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jpda/conninv.html#Invocation</p>

<p>These are the options that work with the example below: -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=9000,server=y,suspend=n</p>

<p>Add this line to your build.xml</p>

<p>&amp;lt;taskdef name=&quot;hotswap&quot; classname=&quot;dak.ant.taskdefs.Hotswap&quot;/&amp;gt;</p>

<p>This is an example of how to hotswap with a JVM on port 9000 on your local machine</p>

<p>&amp;lt;target name=&quot;hotswap&quot;&amp;gt;
<br/>  &amp;lt;tstamp&amp;gt;
<br/>    &amp;lt;format property=&quot;class.tstamp&quot; pattern=&quot;MM/dd/yyyy kk:mm:ss&quot; /&amp;gt;
<br/>  &amp;lt;/tstamp&amp;gt;</p>

<p>  &amp;lt;javac destdir=&quot;${build.classes.dir}&amp;gt;
<br/>    &amp;lt;fileset dir=&quot;${dev.src.dir}&quot; includes=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&amp;gt;
<br/>  &amp;lt;/javac&amp;gt;</p>

<p>  &amp;lt;hotswap verbose=&quot;true&quot; port=&quot;9000&quot;&amp;gt;
<br/>    &amp;lt;fileset dir=&quot;${build.classes.dir}&quot; includes=&quot;**/*.class&quot;&amp;gt;
<br/>      &amp;lt;date datetime=&quot;${class.tstamp}&quot; pattern=&quot;MM/dd/yyyy kk:mm:ss&quot; when=&quot;after&quot; granularity=&quot;0&quot;/&amp;gt;
<br/>    &amp;lt;/fileset&amp;gt;
<br/>  &amp;lt;/hotswap&amp;gt;
<br/>&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;</p>

<p>This example illustrates creating a timestamp with granularity of seconds. Then, compiling the java files that have changed. Finally, the  target uses the timestamp, formatted with seconds, to pick files that have changed since that timestamp and pass them to the  target.
<br/>To get this functionality in the date selector, you&#39;ll need one of these;</p>

<p>The ant 1.6.2 beta.  OR
<br/>The ant 1.6.1 release, plus this jar in the lib directory. (it contains the patch for the date selector).</p>

<p>For Vim users, I recommend using ant.vim to allow you to call a hotswap task from Vim. It (along with this task) lets you edit code, then with a few keystrokes, hotswap the new code into your running app! Very Cool!</p>

<p>I can be reached via e-mail and I lurk on the Ant developers list.</p>

 title : The HTMLColors Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>HTMLColors is an open-source Java class that contains a collection of static methods to manipulate and convert java.awt.Color objects into HTML hexadecimal color representation (#RRGGBB) and vice versa.
<br/>This class extend the com.tecnick.htmlutils Java package that provides a collection of utilities to create, parse and convert HTML/XHTML documents.</p>

<p>The HTMLColors class is useful at least in three common development situations: 
<br/>creation of Web-based documents (HTML, XHTML, CSS, ...); 
<br/>parsing and processing Web-based documents (HTML, XHTML, CSS, ...); 
<br/>store and retrieve colors information on text-based configuration files (TXT, XML, HTML, ...); this last case means that this class can be virtually used in any Java-based application that uses colors.</p>

 title : The GNU/Linux Tricky How To Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>GNU/Linux Tricky How To settles on an important thought: &quot;All the knowledge shall be shared through humanity&quot;. So, as soon as we learn a new thing, we may share it among others. A good place to start sharing and seeking information will be here, where there will be lots of tutorials. The most rich feature is that it depends almost entirely on the community. So, if a user reaches a certain karma, he&#39;ll have automatically the power to add himself a new tutorial and other features. Think of this as a Slashdot + TLDP :-)</p>
 title : The MiMMS isn't an MMS Message Sender Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>mimms is an mms (e.g. mms://) stream downloader
<br/>mimms is a program designed to allow you to download streams using the MMS protocol and save them to your computer, as opposed to watching them live. Similar functionality is available in full media player suites such as Xine, MPlayer, and VLC, but mimms is quick and easy to use and, for the time being, remains a useful program.
<br/>Originally, mimms was forked directly from the last known version of mmsclient, which was for years unmaintained. mimms was started with the following goals:
<br/>* Keep a working copy of &quot;mmsclient&quot; (now &quot;mimms&quot;) well maintained
<br/>* Fix lots of the bugs that were in mmsclient
<br/>* Extend the functionality of the program in useful ways
<br/>Since the 2.x series, mimms shares no code with mmsclient, and actually does all of it&#39;s MMS operations using libmms, a library based off of the xine-improved mmsclient code, which is designed to allow multiple implementations of MMS clients without requiring a fragmented code base. The mimms 3.x series is implemented entirely in python, and is freed from the details of the MMS protocol and architecture dependence, and can focus on usability.
<br/>mimms has only the following major dependencies:
<br/>* python (&gt;= 2.5) -
<br/>* libmms (&gt;= 0.4) -
<br/>Source code is hosted in Bazaar at .</p>

 title : The copyblock Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>copyblock is a very simple command line tool which can work in 2 ways:
<br/>1) reads from a regular file or a block device and writes to stdout,
<br/>it can detect zeroed areas and write sparse files,
<br/>maximum read size can be specified
<br/>(useful when reading block devices containing iso filesystem)
<br/>2) reads from stdin and write to a block device or regular file,
<br/>sync write can be forced
<br/>(useful when writing slow devices and wanting to have good
<br/>progress and ETA)
<br/>In both modes &quot;copyblock&quot; writes to stderr info about progress
<br/>and estimated time to complete.
<br/>Files and block/char devices larger then 4GB are supported.
<br/>I have tested it on:
<br/>GNU/Linux : i686, x86_64, powerpc32
<br/>FreeBSD : i386, x86_64
<br/>Cygwin : i686</p>

 title : The Common Configuration Parser Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>(project is unmaintained)</p>

<p>CCP is a program that reads configuration files and upgrades them. It takes a oldfile (typically the old configuration file currently in use) and a newfile (typically the default new configuration file) and optionally a template (a file which tells ccp how the generated configuration file should look like. It is generated on-the-fly if a template isn&#39;t supplied, so it is usually not needed). CCP first reads all the configuration options and values in the new file, then in the old file, then it either generates the template or reads the supplied template file, finally it merges the files into one - creating a new configuration file that has the changes that was made to the old file but also the new options that is included in the new file.</p>
