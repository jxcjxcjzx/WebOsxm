 title : The NetHack Proxy Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NetHack and its variants communicate with the user via windowing interfaces. These are designed to be modular so that different windowing interfaces can be included when building the game. This flexibility is required both because windowing interfaces are typically much less portable than the game (and thus will not normally support every platform that the games does) and because users have varying preferences as to the style of interface they prefer.
<br/>NetHack Proxy takes this abstraction one stage further by allowing the game and the windowing interface to run in separate processes and even on separate computers.</p>

 title : The MagPlot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MagPlot is a program for generating charts like gnuplot.
<br/>The idea is that while TeX is acknowledged for its quality
<br/>of output, many charts and diagrams especially in Excel
<br/>I have seen are...not so good.
<br/>So for my own satisfaction I wanted to implement
<br/>a program which maintains a high quality standard.
<br/>For that reason I based my work on Edward Tufte&#39;s
<br/>&quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&quot;</p>

<p>Core intention:
<br/>- Very good readability. 
<br/>- Conservative approach:
<br/>     Any feature which sounds &quot;cool&quot; but does not serve
<br/>     a specific purpose or which is harmful for data
<br/>     display will be ditched.
<br/>       - No 3D charts
<br/>       - No more than 2 axes
<br/>       - No bars with moire pattern
<br/>			 - etc.
<br/>- Usability for speed and quality: One mode for fast
<br/>  drawing so that the charts can be used for (hopefully)
<br/>  high-performance real-time display on the screen
<br/>  while supporting high-quality output in the other mode.
<br/>- Console for users which cannot live without keyboard.</p>

 title : The mof Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Mobile Object Factory is a framework for deploying rich
<br/>applications to remote devices. The MOF application is initially
<br/>deployed and acts as a container for applications described via a

<p>The MOF tagset enables creating applications for deployment to
<br/>the Mobile Object Factory via a declarative XML syntax that
<br/>describes a series of screens in a application as wells as how to
<br/>transition between those screens.  Also included in the MOF
<br/>tagset is a simple data model (local variables, tables, ...) and
<br/>a simple event model to permit simple operations when a network
<br/>connection is not available.</p>

<p>The Mobile Object Factory applications (MOFlets) are deployed via
<br/>existing server side Portal technology. This permits the custom
<br/>creation and deployment of applications on a individual user
<br/>basis.</p>

<p>Included in the Mobile Object Factory is a server side component.
<br/>This server side component provides a simple reliable messaging
<br/>protocol (MOFP(S)) that guarantees that each message between the
<br/>server and the client is delivered once and exactly once.</p>

<p>The MOF engine currently has a client runtime for both Java J2ME
<br/>MIDP2.0 enabled devices as well as Desktop Java (J2SE).  The MOF
<br/>engine run-time takes the declarative declaration of a MOFlet and
<br/>renders it appropriately for the device it has been deployed to.</p>

<p>The Mobile Object Factory is freely-distributable Open Source
<br/>software, released under Common Development and Distribution
<br/>License (CDDL) Version 1.0.</p>

 title : The MindIM Jabber Instant Messaging Client Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>MindIM is a Java based Instant Messaging client compliant with XMPP and Jabber standards (e.g. GoogleTalk, jabber.org and Apple iChat).

The goal of the development is:</p>

<p>Provide an intuitive, user friendly experience.
<br/>Consistency of experience across platforms.
<br/>A pluggable architecture that allows custom transports to be added so as to extend MindIM&#39;s capabilities.</p>

 title : The Java User Information Console Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The proposed System contains the following features:
<br/>1. Manage, Remind, Update session information. This would effectively replace the
<br/>existing manual procedure (Only on Mobile device). Users shall be sent links or
<br/>abstracts of the Blogs of Jonathan and other important personalities. Most like we
<br/>would be using RSS feeds for this feature.
<br/>2. A Static Color map. Can be zoomed using device capability.
<br/>3. To improve the quality if the session, the feed back from the attendees shall be used
<br/>to compute the Top five sessions in real time.(this is a nice to have feature which
<br/>available only through Web browser)</p>
 title : The Heroes Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Heroes is similar to the &quot;Tron&quot; and &quot;Nibbles&quot; games of yore, but includes many graphical improvements and new game features.
<br/>In it, you must maneuver a small vehicle around a world and collect powerups while avoiding obstacles, your opponents&#39; trails, and even your own trail.
<br/>There are five game modes available. Quest is the classical Nibbles, in Death Match you start with very long tails and must kill your opponents, in Kill&#39;em All you must run over lemmings moving on the ground, in Time Cash or Color modes you must collect money or pyramids of color. Heroes features 12 original sound tracks, 94 levels (in 10 different tile sets) plus a level editor.
<br/>Heroes&#39; source code (distributed under the GNU General Public Licence version 2) originates from an original MS-DOS game but has been heavily modified to enhance the portability. Some new features have been added and MS-DOS support has been lost by the meantime. The original MS-DOS version can still be found on the Internet but is unmaintained and should be considered obsolete.
<br/>The current development concentrates on cleaning the code and porting the game to the various operating systems available. Our objective is to release the version 1.0 as a clean and portable base that would allow significant additions such as network support or programmable vehicles.</p>
