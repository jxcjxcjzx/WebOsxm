 title : The SIA-Control Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A collection of ruby objects which can be used to control FIA, SIA and MSFIA components and analysers. While other programmes with the same aim limit the users control over most devices, the objects provided here do not limit the access.
<br/>This is especially advantageous for fast applications, where all properties (e.g. the free configurable speed ramps of the CAVRO syringepump) must be used. It is also quite easy to include more and &#39;unusal&#39; devices like a temperature controlled bath (Haake DC 50) with RS232 interface which was used to optimize the temperature of a reaction loop.
<br/>The main DRAWBACK is the (graphical) user interface. There is none :-) Actually it didn&#39;n make any sense to create a user interface, because SIA methods (which are the main purpose of this project) are programmed so any programme editor does the same job.
<br/>Please do not hesitate to contact me, if you have questions about SIA, FIA and MSFIA or programmes and devices related to these techniques. A variation of this set of objects (written by me in python, but not my intelectual property) is used to determine ammonia and phosphate in coastal waters:

 title : The Space Bomber Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Space Bomber is going to be a demo-game for xith3d or odejava newby&#39;s. The idea to create such a game came across one day when Alonzo (one of the participents) had the idea of making a game together with other people who also don&#39;t know very much about xith3D, so they all can do the stuff they know, have fun making the game and also learn the parts they didn&#39;t know before, without having long days of reading the API&#39;s.
<br/>We decided that we want to make a sort of Bomberman in Space and 3D. Odejava is supposed to handle collisions and the movements. Xith3D is supposed to be used as the renderer. In the game you should be able to throw bombs which, because of the physics, move along with the player until the player starts adding force to his spaceship. So this game will need very much skill to make the bombs do what you want, but it will also work for not very experienced user, who just throw bombs now and then.
<br/>We&#39;ve discussed also the variation of the bombs doing no dammage at all to the ships, so you only get damage by colliding to walls, or with other players. The bombs give you then only some extra speed burst that makes you crash against walls if you&#39;re not careful.
<br/>To see the newest state of the discussion go to http://magicspark.org/~willadv/xith/index.php . Please note, that this forum is probably only temporary.</p>

 title : The antcolony Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Introduction</p>

<p>This project build for Java projects development.All projects build with Ant,
<br/>it defined many tasks to build,test,generate,deploy...</p>

<p>If all the tasks defined in one build.xml file,it will be too large and confusing.
<br/>So I defined these tasks in several files,and in build.xml defined some targets 
<br/>to call these in build-XXX.xml.
<br/>With AntColony,you didn&#39;t need create ant build files for every new application,
<br/>even copy and paste.see the Installing and Using part for detail. </p>

<p>And this is NOT one-size-fit-all project,so I suggest you to read these files first,
<br/>then modify the build files to fit your projects.</p>

<p>Requiement</p>

<p>JDK1.4 or later </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t example with JDK1.3,I will do this later.
<br/>Define an environment variable &quot;JAVA_HOME&quot; that points at the base directory 
<br/>of your JDK installation,and add the directory &quot;$JAVA_HOME/bin&quot; to your PATH variable.</p>

<p>Ant1.6 or later 
<br/>With 1.5.1,some problems will occured,I will fix it later.
<br/>Define an environment variable &quot;ANT_HOME&quot; that points at the base directory 
<br/>of your Ant installation,and add the directory &quot;$ANT_HOME/bin&quot; to your PATH variable. </p>

<p>Installing and Using</p>

<p>Extract all files from the zip file to your projects direcotry,for example:
<br/>d:\projects\AntColony.the AntColony directory must case aware! </p>

<p>In DOS command line,go to d:\projects\AntColony,type ant init,it will 
<br/>generate default directories of AntColony. </p>

<p>Download the required libraries and copy to their lib directory,like struts.jar 
<br/>to d:\projects\AntColony\lib\runtime\struts.lib.</p>

<p>For new project,in AntColony directory,type ant newapp-java or ant newapp-j2ee,
<br/>it will prompte for the new project name and generate by default,under d:\projects\ directory. </p>

<p>For the exist project,copy the build-default-java.xml file to the project and 
<br/>rename to biuld.xml,and the build-default-java.properties to biuld.properties.
<br/>And build-default-j2ee.xml and biuld-default-j2ee.properties for J2EE projects. </p>

<p>In project directory,type ant usage for more detail.
<br/>In AntColony directory,type ant -f build-XXX.xml usage for every build-XXX.xml 
<br/>file&#39;s help infomation.XXX is file type,for example:ant -f build-newapp.xml usage.
<br/>Notes:Don&#39;t run the task of build-XXX.xml in AntColony directory except build.xml&#39;s. 
<br/>	
<br/>TODO List</p>

<p>If I have mistake with these build files or you have better files and if you 
<br/>have other build files,please mail me(mail_hanqing {a} yahoo.com) and I will update these.</p>
