 title : The SRC Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Unity (which is the first implementation of the SRC protocol which in turn is part of this project) is an attempt to improve the situation of real-time chatting on networks such as the internet. As a base to work on we have chosen the current Internet Relay Chat protocol.
<br/>We all (at least those of us who have spent some time trying to understand how IRC works) know that the current IRC protocol is not scalable enough for really large networks. That&#39;s because all servers need to know all users and all channels, and everything has to be kept synchronized all the time. When two servers establish a link, the initial synchronization data can be as large as a 100 MB.
<br/>Also, the IRC protocol provides no mechanism to permanently register accounts or even channels, making channels hard to secure against people who want to disrupt a group of chatters.
<br/>Last but not least, IRC servers are either leafs or hubs which route messages to each other which doesn&#39;t really make sense since internet routers do exactly the same thing on a lower level.
<br/>Another drawback of another nature is that IRC servers tend to get organized in small networks, so if someone chooses a network they can&#39;t contact people on other networks without opening a second connection to that other network. Since the administration of those IRC networks usually is very strict on what is allowed on their network and what features their network has, new servers have bad chances of getting involved with an IRC network and keeping a fair bit of freedom at the same time.
<br/>If it was possible to keep all the servers apart without losing the possibility of communication between them, users as well as server administrators would have a lot more freedom to choose what they want.
<br/>Our goal is to do this and end all the problems explained above, together with adding other useful extensions and changes.

 title : The the Orange Slice Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>the Orange Slice permits to edit « scripts » files that contains informations about when and what to print on a video : the subtitles. You can use those scripts with MPlayer (http://mplayerhq.hu/) or Xine (http://xine.sf.net/) for example. If you&#39;re using a WIN32 system, you can use the generated script to encode your videos with Virtual-Dub (http://virtualdub.org/).
<br/>The main goal is to have an easy application to create and edit scripts for subtitling videos. Right now it only manages the Sub Station Alpha (SSA) and Advanced Sub Station Alpha (ASS) file formats. It can also load SUB (MicroDVD?) files. But it should be extended to any common format available in load/save (SUB &amp; SRT at least).
<br/>The possibility to synchronise subtitles with video (or sound), isn&#39;t on the TODO list. If you feel like being able to develop such a thing, please tell me and « just do it » ! But right now, i&#39;m only thinking in terms of subtitle editing, not subtitle timing.</p>

 summary : <p>Gaelle is a web application that helps managing groups of people like LUGs (Linux Users Groups), Associations, development teams,...
<br/>A login system allows members to add/modify/restrict informations that concern themselves. In addition, a visibility feature can be attached to almost every piece of information. For example, one can restrict one&#39;s personal phone number access to members only, in order to prevent anonymous visitors using it.
<br/>Gaelle also keeps track of subscriptions/dues/donations made by members and can remind renewals in case a periodic subscription scheme has been decided upon.
<br/>The gaelle philosophy is that there is no administrator but members with capabilities. Thus, a member can be granted a capability for just only one precise administrative task, in opposition to giving him either the right to do anything or no right at all.
<br/>Further, care have been taken to make sure gaelle remains extensible and can be easily integrated, including the possiblity to use some components out of the gaelle pages. For example the login/capability component can be used in a custom page for just about 5 lines of code.
<br/>Gaelle is written in php/PostgreSQL, makes use of gettext for internationalizisation purposes and is developed with security in mind.</p>

 title : The daim Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Message from the owner(s)
<br/>   Welcome!</p>

<p>Joining the daim project is encouraged. We are especially looking for Swing developers. Knowledge of the AIM/ICQ protocol is not necessary.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you are considering joining the daim project as a Developer, please contact me by email first with your previous Java experience and hopefully a patch (diff -u) of some significant addition you&#39;ve made to the daim source code. This will help me to approve your request.</p>

<p>Supported Features</p>

<p>daim already supports many features, including Add-Ins, AIM Proxy, Buddy Icon, Chat, Direct IM, File Transfer, File Sharing, Send Buddy List and Trillian SecureIM. daim also supports retrieving News and Stocks.  daim tries to support as many features as possible from WinAIM 5.2.</p>

<p>Scripting Support</p>

<p>daim supports scripting through Apache BSF. Sample Jython scripts can be found in the script/ directory in CVS, but any language supported by BSF is supported by daim, including JavaScript and Tcl (among others).</p>

<p>ICQ Support</p>

<p>You may log in using your ICQ UIN and password using daim. daim has full support for the non-TCP portion of the ICQ protocol up to ICQ 2003a.</p>

<p>iChat Support</p>

<p>In addition to ICQ, daim can emulate Apple&#39;s iChat client, and daim supports iChat available messages as well.</p>

<p>Features In Progress</p>

<p>Features currently in progress include AIM 5.2 SecureIM (PKCS12) and ICQ TCP (Chat, Filetransfer).</p>

<p>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</p>

<p>A graphical user interface (GUI) for daim is in early development. Currently, the GUI only supports normal Instant Messaging and some Buddy List functionality. The features listed above as supported refer only to the library portion of daim. Most features have not yet been implemented in the Swing client. As soon as someone has created the GUI components for various protocol features, they can be added to the existing client quite easily.</p>

<p>Other Uses</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see daim used in other ways besides as a backend to a GUI, such as using daim as a Jabber transport.</p>

<p>Building daim</p>

<p>To build daim, the following jars should be added to your CLASSPATH (Linux users should instead use the appropriate package management tool for their distribution, e.g. JPackage):</p>

<p>ant.jar
<br/>bsf.jar
<br/>checkstyle-all.jar
<br/>junit.jar
<br/>log4j.jar
<br/>xerces-j2.jar
<br/>bouncycastle prov and mail packages for your jdk</p>

<p>bouncycastle 1.4: bcmail, bcprov
<br/>bouncycastle 1.3: bcmail, bcprov</p>

<p>You may then build daim using the ant build tool.</p>

<p>Contacting Us</p>

<p>Feel free to email any questions or comments to me, walluck at dev.java.net. See Description for any news.</p>

<br/>package list.
<br/>debsync can do its work either over ssh (default) or rsh.
<br/>debsync is different from fai (Full Automated Installation) because
<br/>AFAIK fai works with machines you plan to install automatically and
<br/>identically, while debsync&#39;s goal is to update a bunch of existing
<br/>and different machines to the level at which they both have the same
<br/>packages installed as those installed on a master host.</p>

 title : The DBA DIALOG Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DBA-Dialog is a dialog interface to the four major RDMS (Oracle, DB2, PostgreSQL and MySQL). It is written in bash, and uses the dialog and Xdialog facility to let a DBA deal with current administration of databases (start, stop, create, dump, restore, a.s.o....). It should also be used to edit crontabs, to dump a particular table, to restore it,...
<br/>It has been written to let people access a local or network database with a lightweight client, therefore not needing a graphical environment or a webserver.
<br/>All what is needed is bash and dialog. Xdialog can also be used. It has only been tested on Linux, with postgresql and Mysql databases, yet, but I hope to test it on different databases soon.</p>

 title : The powchat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Message from the owner(s)
<br/>   </p>

<p>powChat is a server and GUI client standalone chat system that does
<br/> not require a database or application server. It is very quick and dirty 
<br/>code that builds on examples, was built using the netbeans GUI builder 
<br/>and uses basic RMI. It cannot traverse firewalls and is intended as a 
<br/>simple internal chat system, seeing as it was coded before the jabber 
<br/>(XMPP) was so developed and powerful open source systems existed. 
<br/>I am sharing this code in good faith and in a spirit of sharing, as opposed 
<br/>to a sharing of good code! :)</p>
