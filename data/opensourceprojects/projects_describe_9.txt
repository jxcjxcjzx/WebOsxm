 title : The Asimulator Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Asimulator is a simulator for intelligent agents. It can be used in courses in artificial intelligence or for fun. The user can practice the use of search algorithms.
<br/>An Asimulator world consists of a map of up to 129 x 129 tiles, some rules and an agent. The goal for the agent is to understand percepts and respond with actions that result in as high score as possible. The actions are moving around, grabbing items and neutralizing enemies. Collecting items, neutralizing enemies and returning home is good for the score. Wasting actions is bad for the score. Moving into enemies or dangers is really bad for the score (the agent dies). The agent percieves when it is next to an enemy or dagner.
<br/>The simulator is a server application and a client can connect to it over a socket. Therefore agents can be implemented in any programming language that supports sockets.
<br/>A sample client is included as a reference implementation. It is written in Ada. Therefore it is very easy to start writing agents in Ada. Just copy some template files and fill some function bodies. A few sample agents of varying complexity are included. They are written for the Ada interface.
<br/>The server performs the action in the world and sends the resulting percept to the client. It is possible to create imagesets (themes) for the simulator. There are editing features to tweak every variable in the worlds, so it is possible to construct specific testcases. Those can be save and loaded. The client can send symbols to the simulator, which will display them on the map. This gives a visual help in understanding the agent&#39;s thoughts about the world, which aids debugging. Of course the client can also send debug messages as normal text. Asimulator is designed to take advantage of 2 monitors. The map view can be put on one and the text output on the other.
<br/>The simulator reqiures Qt-X11-Free-3.3 and KDE-3.5 (other versions may work but no guarantee). The Ada client reqiures Adasockets-1.8 (other versions will probably work but no guarantee).
<br/>See the documentation that is reachable from the Help menu in the appliction for more information. Currently the only distribution method is CVS.</p>

 title : The Kanaputs Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Kanaputs is an interpreter for Java. No more compilation, each instruction is executed when you write it. With Kanaputs you can write powerful scripts in the Java syntax.</p>

<p>Kanaputs can be embedded very easily into an XML document to do programmatic features. For example, Kanaputs is fully integrated with Ant and provides a way to do Java into an XML Ant build file.</p>

<p>From Kanaputs you can create any object from any kind of jar or class files and invoke methods on them.</p>

<p>The grammar of the Kanaputs language is very close to the Java grammar. One big difference is that any variable handled by Kanaputs is type-less. There is no variable declaration nor type casting needed. Depending on the variable value, and where it is used, Kanaputs chooses the best internal Java basic type and tries the most appropriate type castings. When a variable handles a Java object, its type is the class of the Java object.</p>

<p>Another key feature of Kanaputs is the reactivity. Any variable can be reactive. You just have to choose if the variable is reactive or not. If the variable &#39;c&#39; was defined like this c = a + b; and if the reactivity of &#39;c&#39; is set (c.reactive = true;), each time the value of &#39;a&#39; or &#39;b&#39; changes then the value of &#39;c&#39; is updated as the result of the addition. When a variable is reactive, it listens to the other variables (or field of objects) in order to update its value (by executing all the operations this variable depends on). The reactivity feature is very useful to manage Graphical User Interfaces by listening to any kind of event (like a button click for example) and consequently update variable values in a very simple way.</p>

<p>Kanaputs requires JDK 1.4 or newer to work.
<br/>Download latest version of Kanaputs (zip file for any OS)

 title : The Emacs/RTF Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This package aims to implement the &quot;Rich Text Format&quot; (RTF), version 1.5, as a file format for GNU Emacs. It also provides the necessary framework to edit RTF documents in an Emacs buffer. It is thus intended to enhance the word processing capabilities of the Emacs environment. The goal is to enable a user to edit RTF documents without launching a non-Emacs application like OpenOffice or abiword.
<br/>This package is in a very early state of development. Currently only the reader is in the work, and only the main structure of it is implemented. Some RTF documents are already rendered correctly, though.</p>

 title : The Bontz Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Bontz is what happens when a role-playing game&#39;s programmers are also its designers and writers.
<br/>Furgason is a (mad?) scientist who has just invented a time machine. Unfortunately it only works for travel into the future; he hasn&#39;t figured out how to travel time in reverse yet. Because of this, and because of a rather amusingly-shaped stain on his shirt, he is shunned by the board of scientific snobs. To wreak his revenge, Furgason plans to go back in time and prevent them from ever existing. But first, he must travel forward in time to when he has perfected his time machine (so it can travel backwards) and steal it from himself.
<br/>...thus begins the greatest epic tale of our time... Bontz!
<br/>(The word &quot;bontz&quot;, by the way, works like adding &quot;...not!&quot; to the end of a sentence, nullifying whatever came before it. With the theme of time travel and changing the past to affect the future... well you see the connection.)</p>

 title : The DMiner Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The Idea is to provide libraries for Classification and Prediction algorithms already published by the academic community. The span extends to not only the basic algorithms, but also the recent advancements made in KDD algorithms, for example SWIFT, BOAT and RainForest. The libraries must be scalable and not tied to any one data set.
<br/>The Project will also allow, experimentation and formulation of further optimisation of existing algorithms, an in-depth study of the algorithms and the knowledge extraction portion of the KDD process.
<br/>We plan to implement the libraries in C++. The GNU C++ Compiler will be used. We would like to see the algorithms deployed on *Nix and Windows platforms.
<br/>As a more long-term goal, the project will spawn to include applications for the libraries that we will implement. The application of KDD in messaging infrastructure in general, is an interesting a relatively unexplored area.
<br/>The participants are all from the Rochester Institute of Technology and vocieferously support the concept of &#39;Free&#39; software and other idealogical variants.

 title : The ArkiWeb Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Arkiweb, originally developed for the National Archives of Norway intentionally as free software, is a cross-platform web content management framework based on Apache, PHP, MySQL and Tidy. The project was initiated in September 2001.
<br/>The benefit of the system is to present web pages as clean and valid CSS-formatted HTML with static &quot;readable&quot; URLs, without sacrificing the easy administration and control of a database-driven web site.
<br/>Appearing to end-users as static files (URLs are processed by Apache RewriteRules and passed to a PHP rendering script), the entire site can be periodically exported (using wget) as static HTML and image files to a &quot;static&quot; web server (e.g. high-throughput Linux kHttpd or low-cost static-files-only external web host) from an intranet or localhost &quot;live&quot; ArkiWeb server.
<br/>The business layer contains entity classes encapsulating session handling and database access, as well as functionality to upload and resize images, create thumbnails, clean up input to get valid XHTML, validate links, generate hierachical menus and breadcrumbs.
<br/>The application layer contains site management functionality to add and edit pages, texts, images and menu entries. We want to add WYSIWYG HTML editing functionality for different browsers as this becomes possible.</p>

 title : The The Circle Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Development on the Circle has ceased.
<br/>The Circle is an open source scalable decentralized peer to peer application. What does that mean? Well, there&#39;s no central authority running the show. No entry taxes either, no one booting you off the network, and (in theory) no weak point which can break the whole system. No one even owns the source code. As long as there&#39;s one Circle peer running, anywhere in the world, there&#39;s still a network.
<br/>The Circle currently provides:
<br/>* File sharing
<br/>* Instant messaging and IRC-style chat
<br/>* A personalized, trust based news service
<br/>* Proxying for the Debian apt tool
<br/>The Circle&#39;s scalability derives from its use of a distributed hashtable (aka Chord).

 title : The Synchronizing Key Server Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Here&#39;s a list of some SKS&#39; features:
<br/>Highly efficient and reliable reconciliation algorithm
<br/>Follows RFC2440 and RFC2440bis carefully --- unlike PKS, SKS supports new and old style packets, photoID packets, multiple subkeys, and pretty much everything allowed by the RFCs.
<br/>Fully compatible with PKS system --- can both send and receive syncs from PKS servers, ensuring seamless connectivity.
<br/>Simple configuration: each host just needs a (partial) list of the other participating key servers. Gossip is used to distribute information without putting a heavy load an any one host.
<br/>Supports HKP/web-based querying, and soon-to-be-standard machine readable indices
<br/>The design of SKS is deliberately simple. The server consists of two single-threaded processes. The first, &quot;sks db&quot;, fulfills the normal jobs associated with a public key server, such as answering web requests. The only special functionality of &quot;sks db&quot; is that it keeps a log summarizing the changes to the key database. &quot;sks recon&quot; does all the work with respect to reconciling hosts databases. &quot;sks recon&quot; keeps track of specialized summary information about the database, and can use that information to efficiently determine the differences between its database and that of another host.</p>

 title : The TYK Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TYK (the acronym for Teach Yourself Korean) is a generic tool for practicing vocabulary and grammar of foreign languages, primarily written to aid me in my korean studies. However, TYK will be written with extensibility in mind, in order to use it for other languages and exercises too.
<br/>To accomplish this, TYK is seperated into multiple layers. The main application is a simple browser to chose exercises from the languages and lessons that are available. Excercises themselves are written as dynamic modules, to make TYK easily extensible. The actual data for exercises is provided in XML format, making creation of new lessons and/or exercises as simple as possible.
<br/>Note however, that TYK is no complete language course. Its focus is entirely on practicing vocabulary and grammar. Nothing will be explained to you. So you will need other resources to get an initial understanding of the new language you want to learn. Afterwards, you can use TYK to test and improve your skills.</p>

 title : The Babe Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Babe is a framework for efficient data brokering. The goal for Babe is to provide end to end reliable brokering of diverse data types, independent of the transport protocol being used. Although a daemon is being developed for managing brokering, the framework provides an API so that pieces of the core can be used independently of the daemon. The modular design of Babe allows people to develop new input, output, and format modules easily. New modules are loaded into the core based on config file options, so using a new module does not require a user to recompile any applications. Babe allows data types to be translated and forwarded. Currently we are researching methods for doing semantic type mapping to deal with translations from loosely typed data sets to strongly typed data sets. Babe is still in the planning phase.</p>

 title : The Colibri Conference Manager Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>In order to select papers that will be published in a scientific conference, normally two steps are needed.
<br/>First of all, an automated system for paper submissions by the authors must be put online, then a way to distribute papers to reviewers and to collect their reviews should be found.
<br/>The submissions management system should accept new submissions and give to the author(s) the way to manage them (modifying something or withdrawing them) as long as submissions are open, and to track them when they are under review (i.e. to know their status).
<br/>The review management system should offer an easy way to add Program Commettee members to the system, to distribute papers to them with some load balancing kept in mind (but not always automatization helps in this case), to collect their reviews an</p>

<br/>   There are numerous SwingUtil classes and packages all over the internet.  I&#39;ve created a project here where I&#39;ve placed my swing utilities that I always use.  If you&#39;ve got utilities that you use, please consider contributing them to this project.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve added Generics support to a second source tree in this project.  I reworked the org.wonderly.swing.prefs package to use the Generics support so that it could be used for more than just swing component mappings.</p>

<br/>Generics Version Java Docs
<br/>This version includes the use of Generics to help make many of the classes cleaner and less error-prone due to casting bugs.</p>
