 title : The xmltest Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>XMLTest simulates a multi-threaded server program that processes multiple XML documents in parallel. This is very similar to an application server that deploys web services and concurrently processes a number of XML documents that arrive in client requests. XMLTest concentrates on on XML processing performance by acting as a standalone multi-threaded program that processes XML document files. To avoid the effect of file I/O, the documents are read from and written to memory streams. It is implemented in both Java and C# .
<br/>XMLTest measures the throughput of a system processing XML documents. The notion of an XML transaction here corresponds to a complete life cycle of an XML document. For tree building parsers this requires the four steps of parse, access, modify and serialize while for streaming parsers it just involves parse and access. XMLTest reports one metric: Throughput - Average number of XML transactions executed per second.</p>

The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership (if it is running as root), modification times, acls, eas, resource forks, etc. Finally, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted.</p>

 title : The A logging anti-framework. Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Simple Log is logging anti-framework.
<br/>It is written in protest against the many &quot;logging frameworks&quot; that are available and recommended by many developers.

<br/>ff3d, as well as its cousins, is a PDE solver driven by a
<br/>user-friendly language. It solves many kind of problems such as
<br/>elasticity, fluids (Stokes and Navier-Stokes) and a lot more. The
<br/>user has to enter the equation associated with the problem, giving
<br/>either the PDE in strong formulation or weak (variational)
<br/>formulation.
<br/>ff3d can use either the Finite Elements method (the mesh of the
<br/>geometry being provided by the user) or a Fictitious Domain like
<br/>approach where the geometry is described using Constructive Solid
<br/>Geometry (CSG). This description is done using the POV-Ray language
<br/>but others such as VRML could be added.
<br/>The processing of the results is left to the user. One can use
<br/>various graphic tools: output in the MEdit mesh format or VTK are
<br/>supported. The implementation of a VTK base visualization module is
<br/>underway.
<br/>The goal of ff3d is to provide a good teaching tool and a research
<br/>toolbox (the code is written in C++ and its design is such that new
<br/>methods can be easily implemented).</p>
