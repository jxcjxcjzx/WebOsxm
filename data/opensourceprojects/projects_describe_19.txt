 title : The Generic Forensic Zip Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Generic Forensic Zip is a set of tools and libraries for creating and
<br/>accessing randomly accessible forensic zip files of disk images.
<br/>These files that use an open format (gfzip) defined by this project,
<br/>allow a dd disk image to be stored in compressed form and yet be
<br/>randomly accessable through the libgfz library. A second library,
<br/>libgfzcreate is made available by this project to allow the creation
<br/>of gfz files from programs used to acquire disk image data. Finally the
<br/>project includes a set of basic commandline tools for the creation
<br/>and verification of gfzip files and for restoring dd images from the
<br/>gfz files. Next to compression, the gfzip files are made &#39;safe&#39; for
<br/>forensic use by the use of x509 certificates and the use of multi level
<br/>digests (sha256). The x509 certificate that is used to sign the gfz
<br/>file is embedded into the file, thus carrying all relevant information
<br/>about the person who acquired the image within the file.
<br/>One further feature thet gfzip allows is the embedding of (signed)
<br/>enviroment data and commandline attributes that may be useful as
<br/>metadata in the further processing of the image files. This metadata may
<br/>include for example information about the source of the data and the
<br/>time it was aquired.
<br/>Future versions of gfzip will also include bad-block information, this
<br/>is a feature defined in the file format, but not implemented in the
<br/>first release of gfzip.</p>

 title : The Java Ranking Service Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JRS is a library that ranks players based on their relative performances and uses these rankings for matchmaking and building leaderboards.</p>

<p>The current implementation is based on The Glicko-2 algorthim developed by Professor Mark Glickman at Boston University. (http://math.bu.edu/people/mg/)</p>

<p>Glicko-2 is differentiated from many previous ad-hoc systems in that it is a mathematically rigorous system that treats rankings as hidden statistical variables and attempts to deduce them based on statistical analysis of wins and losses over time.</p>

<p>It has been accepted by the United States Chess Federation and a number of other ranked head-to-head sports as their official ranking system.</p>

<p>Glico-2 in its current form only formally supports 1:1 games. This project will include some experimental ad-hoc n:n support.  Professor Glickman has expressed some interest in properly extending Glico-2 to n:n. If/when that happens we will likely move to his solution.</p>

 title : The Readies Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A Gnome Desktop Application providing Personal Finance functionality.
<br/>This project (Readies) aims to provide simple to use functions to monitor day-to-day financial transactions, and hopefully over time will build up to provide comprehensive reporting and alerting functionality.
<br/>The project is written in Perl, with Glade providing the user interface, and the Perl SQLite DB module providing the underlying data store. The choice of SQLite give myself access to a full-featured and fast storage layer, whilst removing any configuration issues that a &#39;real&#39; RDBMS would need - the target user of this project is very much a desktop user, not a system admin.
<br/>Future developments will probably include XML for configuration management. A graphing system has yet to be designed.
<br/>This project should run on any system that has Perl and Gnome 1.4 - at the moment it has been tested on Mandrake Linux 9.0. GCC 2.9.5 or better is required to install the SQLite Perl module, which is accessible from the CPAN archive.
<br/>This project is not in competition with gnucash - gnucash offers a huge amount of functionality suitable for Home and Small Business use. Readies aims to be offer a much smaller range of functions tailored specifically for casual home use.</p>

 title : The TwinPeaks Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Indiana University Libraries Information Technology is working on a pilot experiment to develop a user interface for accessing digital library resources from within the Sakai course management environment.  Titled “Twin Peaks” to illustrate the currently separate mountains of library and course management resources being bridged, it is a fully JSR168 compliant tool being developed as an experimental option within the new WYSIWYG authoring tool of Sakai.  Currently available resources are limited so the effort as is centered on foundational aspects of user interface and integration into Sakai.   The goal is to provide a system to make it easier for instructors with limited time and very limited technical expertise to simply locate and reuse digital content, in the widest sense of such content (licensed, local, any media, etc).  This tool encompasses several practical functions for teaching and learning like reading lists, creation of guided searches, and course or subject specific web pages.  The functionality is targeted for eventual acceptance as a default tool within the core Sakai code.</p>

<p>Challenges include:</p>

<p>Sakai itself is rapidly evolvingstill undergoing steady changes in integration of the four lead institutions’ efforts.  We are in essence adding a customized functionality to a moving target that is barely in production and mostly a pilot effort itself. 
<br/>Few licensed database/journal vendors currently offer natively persistent links.  Those that do offer them in vendor specific formats not consistent in interface or format.
<br/>Majority of library vendors resist avoidance of their local “branding” that occurs when  libraries or search engines attempt to execute a direct search ( and occasionally such direct searches, depending on frequency or scope, can violate licensing agreements)
<br/>Citation lists obtained via meta-searching my not result in links that offer intuitive “one click” access to the full text resources.  This could be because the tool requires a re-search to be executed to ensure currency of the full text availability or due to the resource only offering abstract level coverage.
<br/>Common current practice in library collections development of electronic resources is to periodically review options for obtaining particular serials to choose the best price among vendors who offer the same titles.  It is not unusual for libraries to therefore switch various titles as pricing changes or better options become available.  Thus, even a link that was persistent when it was obtained in search results may later break as the vendor is dropped in favor of another.</p>

<p>As this project is tied to the overall Sakai Project, all related software is open source, licensed under the Educational Community License Version 1.0</p>

 title : The Robot Simulation and Control Lab Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>RSCL provides a framework to develop applications to simulate and control a mobile robot.  It has been used successfully with vastly different medium sized (~150 lb) autonomous ground vehicles.</p>

<p>RSCL supports the development of robots that follow most cognitive models, including classic sequential (sense-plan-act), the more modern three-layer architecture, and everything in-between by allowing the user to design core functions to run as part of a sequence or as a service (thread).</p>

<p>The framework can provide an ambiguous link between real-world and simulation, allowing many systems to be fully tested prior to the construction of a robot.  It also provides great failure-mode-analysis through logged repeatable simulation.</p>

<p>A settings repository facilitates inter-system and inter-process monitoring and control of system internals.  This also allows system internals to be tweaked at runtime, locally or remotely, to significantly speed up development.  The Swing-based GUI takes advantage of this repository, dynamically creating options panels that contain all the settings of a given system.</p>

<p>Low-level robot control is achieved through communicating with a microcontroller or motor control unit using standard Java (for control over Ethernet), non-standard Java libraries (EIA232 uses javacomm) and native binaries (for parallel port interfaces).  With the emergence of microcontrollers that run Java apps, it is even possible to include large portions of the microcontroller software in simulation.</p>

<p>RSCL leverages non-standard Java libraries and open-source third-party libraries:</p>

<br/>JMF
<br/>javacomm
<br/>OpenGL - JOGL - Xith3D
<br/>ODE - odejava</p>

 title : The SecureSkat Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>SecureSkat is a peer-to-peer implementation of the German card game Skat. The program negotiates possible players and game sessions over an arbitrary IRC network (Internet Relay Chat). Further it employs LibTMCG to gain a reasonable level of fairness.
<br/>The cryptographic protocols of SecureSkat are designed with respect to the &#39;honest-but-curious&#39; (aka semi-honest) adversary model. Thus we don&#39;t care about robustness or strong availability which are hard to achieve in a asynchronous environment. The success of a cheating player can be bound by the security parameter t such that the soundness error probability (w.r.t. performed card operations) is less or equal than 2^{-t}. However, we cannot prevent that malicious players share information about their private cards. But the protocols ensure that the shuffling of the deck is performed randomly (provided that at least one player is honest) and hence that the cards are distributed uniformly among the players.</p>

<p>SiteMesh won&#39;t tread on your toes or force you to work in a certain way (except for cleaner) - you install and carry on working as before. It seamlessly fits in with existing frameworks.</p>

 title : The DataBase Components Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Here I like to implement a data base component, through which the programmers can easily interact with the database in a distributed environment. 
<br/>   There is no need for the users to know where the database is, and the type of database application.
<br/> This component can accept a universal query from the user and then it will finout where the database is situated and transfer that query to that remote station.
<br/>  In the receiving side the query will be processed and the result will be transfered back .
<br/>  The major problems that can occur in this transactions are
<br/>1.Dead lock
<br/>2.Synchronization( Internal or external)
<br/>3.Query Processing
<br/>4.Crash recovery  etc
<br/>If we can solve these issues, then it will be a great help for the programmers in the Distributed environment.</p>

 title : The virtualitty Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Virtualitty is a network-distributed shared 3D world environment.
<br/>This means it can be thought of a quake-like environment spred thru
<br/>several servers. It does not mean our aim is a network distributed FPS game,
<br/>no, the target is much further :)
<br/>We want to create a universally usable environment with a dynamically
<br/>changing geography - i.e. the servers can connect and disconnect from
<br/>the network, without taking down the whole world, while the user transparently
<br/>walking thru the world domains actually travels from server to server
<br/>as internetwide, as transparent.
<br/>With such a massive goal, we make an accent on world representation
<br/>efficiency. It means that the target lies at making creation of
<br/>the world simpler, but ofcourse not at the cost of braindead overhead
<br/>and code bloat :)</p>

 title : The EpA - Cooperative Editor Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>EpA is a web cooperative editor focused in learning environments. Teachers can use EpA to publicize writing tasks to be done by their students. Also, they can evaluate group or individual activities during composition, besides evaluating the texts themselves. Students then use EpA to write and discuss their texts in small groups. Discussion can be on-line or off-line. The idea behind EpA is that writing and discussing together the students can learn better about the issues in discussion. 
<br/>Main Features include:
<br/>- tasks management and evaluation (per task, per group, per student or text itself) 
<br/>- text edition by paragraph with conflicting editions tracked
<br/>- discussions (on and off-line) can be general or tied to specific paragraphs. 
<br/>- users and groups management
<br/>- intelligent user support. 
<br/>EpA is a Java aplication, using standard jsp, hibernate persistence framework and mysql database. I have also a running version with forum, chat, text edition with conflicting editions tracked. It is being developed as part of a research project in Informatics in Education. 
<br/>Now I need a space for cooperative programming, because I have two other people interested in helping with it. Also, I need some public space to offer file downloads to potential users. 
<br/>In near future, I expect to have colaborators in creating an English version of it (it is in Brazilian Portuguese).</p>
