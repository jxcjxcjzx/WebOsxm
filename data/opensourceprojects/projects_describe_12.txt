 title : The MakeModules Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>mamo stands for MakeModules. Working on top of GNU-make
<br/>http://make.paulandlesley.org/ and the Template Toolkit
<br/>http://template-toolkit.org/ its intention is to automate common
<br/>tasks to the highest degree possible. You should be able to create a
<br/>source file, tell mamo about it and the targets you want and let
<br/>mamo care about the rest.</p>

<p>mamo consists of a collection of Makefile snippets called
<br/>modules. Each module defines features for a single or some related
<br/>common tasks. For instance module C defines features for generating
<br/>object files from C sources, module Pod defines features to
<br/>generate documentation from pod sources, while module Install
<br/>defines features for installing files in various ways locally or on a
<br/>remote host. The important module Subdirectory defines recursive
<br/>operation in a directory tree. In no way the tasks are limited to
<br/>programming. For instance mamo can be used to maintain a web site.</p>

<p>mamo is used from a user Makefile. The Makefile has to do two
<br/>things:</p>

<p>Include two mamo parts by using GNU-make&#39;s include directive</p>

<p>Define the make variables which tell mamo about the sources and
<br/>targets maintained by this Makefile</p>

<p>Besides that such a Makefile may contain additional rules and
<br/>definitions which may or may not relate to mamo.</p>

<br/>It mantains a persistent contact list, and it works like an &quot;instant messenger&quot; program in the sense that when a contact connects, you immediatly see that she/he is connected (and she/he sees you).
<br/>You have a &quot;window&quot; for every connected contact (like ircII or BitchX windows). On the right of the terminal, you see a list of all contacts (connected or not). That&#39;s where you see which contacs are connected, which contacts said something while you&#39;re not in their windows, etc. You add contacts with the &quot;/add&quot; command. Other commands exist to modify and remove contacts.
<br/>Plans for the future include support for encrypted communications, unicode, IPv6, file transfers, X-windows (Kopete, GTK+)... We need your help to develop all these things!!</p>

 title : The phpWEBkit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>phpWEBkit is a PHP-based web-publishing system. Friends of good design are left with all liberties of HTML, editors get an easy way of changing the content of a web site without the hassle of special languages or tools.
<br/>This is achieved by storing all content in a database; the formatting is done via templates which can be changed with any HTML editor.
<br/>In contrast to other Content Management Systems phpWEBkit divides a web site into ranges. These ranges are recursively processed with a so-called &quot;Parser&quot;. If a range is not assigned to special template, the standard template will be used automatically. This assignment is controlled by a simple variable.
<br/>Thus any functionality can actually be visualized within the kit.
<br/>The content is stored in the database in several languages and category-dependently. It can be changed right there - in pure ASCII with special tags or in HTML - with any web browser. Additionally, the system currently supports the WYSIWYG editor &quot;Composite&quot;, a plugin to Mozilla. Support for the InterNet Explorer is planned.
<br/>From this description, the assumtion is correct that phpWEBkit is not focussing the home user who wants to create a website with a few mouseclicks. The target group are developers and web designers who are looking for a system which is flexible to a considerable degree and nearly indefinitely expandable.
<br/>However, because all fundamental functions are actually made available by the kit, a static site without interaction can be set up in a few hours.
<br/>The requirements for phpWEBkit are Linux as operating system, an Apache webserver with mod_rewrite activated, MySQL as database and PHP4.</p>

 title : The jban Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Bluetooth network is limited in size and scope. Although piconets can be configured to form a scatternet, the process is usually not dynamic and practical, and the network formed is not robust. In this project, we designed a new way to form adhoc network at the Java application level. Using JSR82 Bluetooth discovery agent and MIDP connection framework, JBAN allow many devices to form a network dynamically, and the devices can be of any type if only they support Java and Bluetooth. JBAN does not concern about which device is master or slave, and all the routing and network management are performed at high level. JBAN will take the advantage if low level networking is better optimized.</p>

<p>JBAN can be used for any application that involves Bluetooth networking. Some examples are Bluetooth based multi-player game, home network, sensor network, and class or meeting utility software. Furthermore, the concept of JBAN can be applied to WIFI or heterogeneous network as well.</p>

The efficiency will be achieved partly by using Objective Caml instead of Java to develop this implementation.  The robustness will be achieved by using existing libraries and code wherever possible, and by keeping the design simple.  The proper documentation will be achieved by the fact that there will be two implementations of the same protocol, so my work at interpreting the java source code will allow easy production of documentation.</p>

 title : The Attune - an adaptive music player Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>A tune, a tune, my kingdom for a tune! - Richard III (almost!)  </p>

<p>I&#39;d been using WinAmp for the most part and was getting a little tired of forwarding by tracks that I didn&#39;t care to hear. I have many MP3s and would like to hear some of them often, and others not so often. I decided it was time to write my own MP3 player so that I would tweak it to work just the way I wanted. The results are here. Somewhat a work in progress, but I do use it daily.
<br/>This music player will learn the musical tastes of the user by monitoring input and play songs that the user likes most.</p>

<p>The names comes from this dictionary lookup;
<br/>at-tune    tr.v. at-tuned, at-tun-ing, at-tunes
<br/>1. To bring into a harmonious or resoponsive relationship.
<br/>2. To tune (an instrument)</p>

<p>This player is designed to be simple and useful for my daily listening. I hope that other users will feel the same.</p>

<p>To contribute, skills with Swing, JMF and file I/O are helpful.</p>

<p>The &quot;Issue Tracker&quot; contains defects, features, tasks, etc. Please check there and let me know if you&#39;d like to work on something.</p>

 title : The Mona Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Mona is an application framework for the `Management of Network Accounts&#39;. This means that with Mona it is easy to associated IP addresses with `users&#39; and control their network connectivity. Furthermore Mona contains functionality for counting traffic and disabling users automatically when a certain limit is reached.
<br/>The application is designed as a client-server system, which means that there is basically one Mona server and potentially several clients; at the moment there are two clients: one simple but powerful `Mona shell&#39; and a CGI web interface.
<br/>Because of the modular architecture it should be quite easy to extend or replace the functionality.
<br/>Mona is primarily developed for use in student hostels, where students have a certain amount of traffic available and where it should be easy for administrators to register new users. But I hope that it is or will be general enough so that it can be used in different environments as well.</p>

 title : The nrdo Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>nrdo (NetReach Database Objects) is a database programming tool.
<br/>Its primary purpose is to make database programming easier and more convenient. To this end, it performs two separate but related functions:
<br/>1) It allows database table definitions to be specified in a source code file. This provides a number of advantages: The files can be maintained in source code control, it is easy to upgrade an old installation to the latest version of the database, and it is possible to include more semantic information than the database itself actually knows. nrdo is invoked at compile time: it reads these table definition (.dfn) files, checks the current state of the database, and performs whatever CREATE or ALTER statements are necessary to make the database match the dfn file.
<br/>2) It generates all the repetitive code that is necessary to access the database from a programming language. Current supported output languages are Java and C#, but the language output is generic and new languages are easy to support. Instead of manually creating a database connection, executing an SQL statement, looping over the results and reading the returned data values manually, nrdo generates a class that represents a data row, for each table. It makes use of the extra semantic information in the dfn file to provide functions or methods to retrieve rows of the database by whatever criteria you specify.</p>
 title : The TypEx Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TypEx uses Java classes to extract data from streams of XML data. The extracted data is made available as instances of the specified classes. Instances are retrieved via either an Iterator or Observer mechanism. In either case, efficient Java code for a pull parser is generated to extract the data.</p>

<p>TypEx differs from other data binding approaches in that it does not require a schema for data, and it allows for partial descriptions.</p>

 title : The Durito Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Durito: Documents foUnd, Reproduced and studIed using a free software applicaTiOn
<br/>Durito is an application that will manage, deliver and analyse various types of documents in a diversity of environments. It is yet unfinished; I hope that it will eventually become a solid, flexible framework for publishing digital archives of all kinds, especially audiovisual material and structured texts (such as those that follow the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines).
<br/>Durito&#39;s development thus far has been driven by specific projects that I have been involved in. Current work is directed towards the creation of a digital photo library that will allow the simultaneous management of information in a diversity of catalographic formats. The code for a prototype of this program is available via anonymous CVS.
<br/>Durito functions using Semantic Web technologies; all metadata is stored using RDF and OWL. The general application framework is currently Apache, mod_perl and AxKit. Any offers of help are extremely welcome.
