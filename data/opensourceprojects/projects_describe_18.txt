The &quot;client&quot; peers from this network can use this environment to submit/run their own jobs, basically, programs written in Java and stored on signed jar files, which can use nodes reachable from the net.
<br/>The user submissions are processed by several &quot;broker&quot; nodes, which determine the best candidate node/s to process any received job petition by first analyzing its computational cost: CPU usage, jobs queue, time as edge, average of completed job, etc. Once this evaluation is done, the petition is assigned and executed on the remote peer/s. Finally, the output result from the job execution is returned to the source peer, the owner of the petition.</p>

 title : The daDrill Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>daDrill is a web-based graphical tool for managing a collection of bibliographical references. daDrill allows the user to add references, browse the available references, query the database for keywords. In addition, daDrill automatically indexes author names when adding a reference, so papers can also be grouped by author.
<br/>daDrill is made to be compatible with the BibTeX format. New entries can be entered by copy-pasting a BibTeX file. Entries are internally stored by preserving all BibTeX fields. Moreover, each entry can be re-exported as a well-formatted BibTeX string. Author names that are automatically added are automatically split into 4 parts in the same way as BibTeX does.
<br/>In addition to standard support for all BibTeX fields, daDrill also offers a few extended features. A plain-text/Markdown comment can be entered for every reference, thus providing additional annotations for the user of the database. In addition to the regular URL BibTeX field, daDrill allows the user to store a reference to a local PS or PDF file. In the &quot;paper details&quot; view, an clickable icon links to the local file that can be immediately opened.
<br/>The entries are stored in a MySQL database. The web interface is written in PHP and uses either the \&#39;mysql\&#39; or the new \&#39;mysqli\&#39; PHP module. Although the system can be used remotely without any modification, it is principally intented for a local use; in such case, a web server such as Apache is needed with the PHP module, along with the MySQL server itself.</p>

 title : The GUI Databinding Framework Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This framework provides a completely event-driven mechanism for binding GUI components (ie. Swing, Echo, SWT, etc) to backing data models.  It reduces the problem of how to synchronize view state with your data model to as little as a single line of code per component.  Common interaction styles such as switching components between view and edit mode as well as supporting controlled propogation of data from the view to the model (typically in support of a view/edit/save/cancel interaction) are fully supported and straight-forward.  The framework seeks to be agnostic to the type of model which is supported or the type of GUI which will be used.  Implementing a new model or view component binding is as simple as implementing the correct interface or extending one of the provided base classes.  Currently, implementations exist for binding to JavaBean models (supporting PropertyChange events) and Swing views.</p>

<p>The framework also includes a tool for creating skeletal JavaBeans with full PropertyChange support from a set of property files.</p>

 title : The WebSpine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>WebSpine is a framework MVC (Model View Controller), which has the objective to provide faster and simplicity to develop Web applications. In this framework , the process of validation is based in rules, but encapsulated to developer. However, it doesn’t obstruct that the developer implement his/her rules, necessary in cases of specific validations, or implement the validation process by traditional way.
<br/>  
<br/>   
<br/>    The principles of the WebSpine are simple (and obvious): 
<br/>· How much less code the programmer writes, minor the error possibilities, time of development and tests of code; 
<br/>· Once validated a rule, doesn’t have reason to implement it again only due the parameter name to be validated is different and independent of project; 
<br/>. How much simple is the utilization and configuration of the tool, faster is the training time, of utilization and development; 
<br/>. The tool must use to advantage the resources that already exist and implement only what still it doesn’t exist;</p>

<p>Besides this, this framework to provide ways to implement secure applications through filters and access mapping through XML configuration files.</p>

 title : The Tensor extension to the GSL Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This package provides a library which is an extension for the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
<br/>It allows to define and manipulate tensors, multidimensional arrays of any order with the same dimension for every index. Tensors generalize vectors and square matrices, and provide powerful functions like tensorial product, index contraction and index swapping.
<br/>The library interface is very similar to that of gsl_matrix, and most of the functions that exist for gsl_matrix are also implemented for tensors and have the same syntax.
<br/>Its sister project is &quot;marray&quot;, which defines a new type similar to tensor but with an arbitrary dimension for each index (for matrices, that would be rectangular matrices), but without the tensor operations defined. It is suited to work with data grids. &quot;marray&quot; can be found at http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/marray/
<br/>There is online documentation available at http://snow.phys.uwm.edu/tensor

 title : The TwinLisp Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TwinLisp is a language with C/Java - like syntax, but with internals and abilities of a Common Lisp (it is a twin of a lisp internally). TwinLisp is implemented as a translator from its own syntax to lisp code, which can be executed by any CL implementation.
<br/>TwinLisp code is translated into CL code. CL code is essentialy an AST (abstract syntax tree) for an initial code. First of all, this tree is human-readable. Second, there is a macro facility to manipulate AST, which gives TwinLisp powers of Lisp in a convenient form (syntax).
<br/>One may use Common Lisp inside TwinLisp code, and use TwinLisp inside Common Lisp. In this way, it is possible to evolve existing CL code with TwinLisp. Moreover, all CL libraries are available in TwinLisp, and TwinLisp libraries can be used in CL.</p>

 title : The Zilonis Rules Engine Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Welcome to Zilonis!
<br/>The objective of this project is to provide a 
<br/>Multithreaded Rules Engine platform and a scripting environment
<br/>for Java based applications. </p>

<p>The core of the Zilonis platform is based on a variation of 
<br/>the forward chainning Rete algorithm described in &quot;Rete: A Fast
<br/>Algorithm for the Many Pattern/ Many Object Pattern Match Problem&quot;, 
<br/>Charles L. Forgy, Artificial Intelligence 19(1982), 17-37.).</p>

<p>The implementations follows the optimizations and the structure used in 
<br/>the Soar system, and the ones 
<br/>well described in the paper: 
<br/>&quot;Production Matching for Large Learning Systems&quot;, Robert B. Doorenbos.
<br/>1995</p>

<p>Multithreaded Capabilities
<br/>A nice feature and contribution from Zilonis, is that it is multithreaded.
<br/>Because of that, it is easy to reuse a set of rules across several concurrent
<br/>users in a safe way, without creating copies of the rules and the engine,
<br/>as you would have to do if you were to use other engines. 
<br/>With Zilonis, you have a solid platform to develop knowledge base driven 
<br/>systems. The rules representation language is similar to the one used in
<br/>CLIPS. Most of the
<br/>rules that you are currently using in  
<br/>CLIPS,
<br/>should be able to run with very little modifications under Zilonis as well.</p>

<p>For information about installing and using it, please go to the home page of the project
<br/>The Zilonis License is free for non-commercial use.</p>

<p>For alternative licenses, like commercial use contact the author.</p>

 title : The c-service Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This project was registered for the following purpose:
<br/>&quot;C-services is an irc-service intended for a wide range of irc-servers. Currently only vantage (can be found on ftp.krey.net) is supported, but the next fase in our project is porting it to other servers. C-services doesn&#39;t use the nickserv, chanserv, operserv etc principle, it uses one central bot that performs all the tasks. Among the allready supported features are: registering channels, kicks, clearchans (mass operations on an entire chans, kick everyone, remove all bans, ..), kills, glines, jupes, ... Data is stored in a mysql-database. One of the key features of our services is the fact that users remain loged in, even if services go offline for a short period. (The vantageserver has special commands to provide this features, for other ircd&#39;s user data is going to be stored elsewhere).
<br/>C-services depends on the mysql-library. It&#39;s written in C&quot;
<br/>Sam Hermans, this project author, cease to develop and maintain it. This project is now orphan. Existing source code remains in the CVS source tree.
