<br/>- Client for MOO with text editor.
<br/>Release notees/Change log:
<br/>13/03/1999 Bang 1.1 Alpha:
<br/>We have just managed to get the Jini/JavaSpaces services up and running on the public
<br/>Internet.
<br/>The server is unstable, running pre1 of Java2 JDK1.2 on Linux. We&#39;ll be clearing the
<br/>persistent database all the time so if you build something beautiful don&#39;t expect it to
<br/>persist.
<br/>New Features:
<br/>-Large Distributed Shared Persistent 3D Space (bangSpace)
<br/>-Sector system for handling loading and unloading of chunks of space/geometry
<br/>-bangMaps, navigational tool for navigating 2D websites in 3D
<br/>-Meta-Authoring, insert VRML97, J3D, SpaceMark &amp; bangMaps into the space and
<br/>build your own worlds. Currently you can only insert object, but in beta2 you&#39;ll be
<br/>able to move/rot/scale all object entries. This is not intended to author geometry, but as
<br/>a space assembly tool.
<br/>-Memory monitor with history graph
<br/>-Bang now includes the Jini implementation from Sun Microsystems
<br/>The persistent model is built using Jini and JavaSpaces.
<br/>Current todo list:
<br/>-Fix the 3D compass
<br/>-Implement the new VNet and extend it to support the Sector system for shared behaviors
<br/>-Implement the Sector unloading part (garbage collection)
<br/>-Select and Delete objects from bangSpace.
<br/>-...
<br/>-..
<br/>-.
<br/>20/01/1999 Bang 1.0:
<br/>-Features
<br/>Multi-user 3D shared spaces.
<br/>Cross platform, written in Java 2 and Java3D.
<br/>VRML97 support for worlds and avatars using..
<br/>Video chat using RTP through JMF1.1 FCS.
<br/>Support for native Java3D file format trough the LoadInterface3D class.
<br/>Shared avatars using IP-Multicasting, VNet and/or DeepMatrix.
<br/>Full screen desktop version included.
<br/>Jini/JavaSpaces based webcrawlers that create multiuser 3D maps of the Internet
<br/>Voice navigation and chat with JavaSpeech 1.0.
<br/>Client for MOO with text editor.
<br/>13/03/1999 Bang Beta 4:
<br/>J3D.classfileformatfor3D content/scenes/worlds added using the
<br/>LoadInterface3D.class. This enables you to build interactve 3D content
<br/>using Java1.2 &amp; Java3D, loaded over the web as .class files.
<br/>You can deploy any of the J3D loaders in those applications/scenes,
<br/>so many new geometry format can now be used in addition to VRML97. You
<br/>can also write your own geometry loaders for special purpose applications.
<br/>support for HeadsUpDisplay added.
<br/>01/01/1999 Bang Beta 3:
<br/>- Features added/Bugs fixed:
<br/>Support for RTP real-time video chat trough Java Media Framework1.1 FCS
<br/>Desktop version of bang added, that will take over your
<br/>screen and run bang under JDesktopPane ;) This is a option only
<br/>there is also the good old JFrame version.
<br/>- Initial support for Jini/JavaSpaces.
<br/>The method saveVRML added, that will go out on the net using a URL,
<br/>load and parse a VRML97 file and upload the 3D content and behaviors
<br/>into JavaSpaces as a compressed Java3D BranchGroup object.
<br/>Then there is the method loadRoom3D that contacts the JavaSpaces server
<br/>and loads the compressed Java3D BranchGroup object into the live scene
<br/>graph.
<br/>This should result in fast loading of (former) VRML content,
<br/>but its broken ;( because Java3D Objects are not serializable yet.
<br/>I&#39;ve included this for you to hack on, Jini/JavaSpaces is a seriously
<br/>interesting subject in the 3D context.
<br/>20/12/1998 Bang Beta 2:
<br/>In addition to VRML97, bang now supports native Java3D .class
<br/>objects, downloadable from web servers for worlds and MOO
<br/>objects. You will have to implement the LoadInterface3D to
<br/>your application before bang can load it. Also your root
<br/>17/12/1998 Bang Beta 1:
<br/>Changed name to Bang.
<br/>I´ve only tested this with the new IBM JavaSpeech implementation and ViaVoice98 but it works really well ;-)
<br/>I´ve only implemented some basic 3D voice navigation, yet. Controlling your journey, trough 3D worlds using your voice is a new dimension all together and very hard to describe in words.
<br/>Here are the voice commands that have been implemented after 1 day of hackin&#39;
<br/>Turning left: Turn left/Move left/Left
<br/>Turning right: Turn right/Move right/Right
<br/>Move forward: Move forward/Forward/Walk/Go forward
<br/>Move backwards: Move back/Back/Backwards/Go back
<br/>Run: Run/Faster
<br/>Stop: Halt/Stop
<br/>09/12/1998 JavaMOO Alpha 5:
<br/>- Features added/Bugs fixed:
<br/>Enhanced for JDK1.2 (Java 2.0) and J3D1.1 (Final release).
<br/>3D Sound Support.
<br/>Swing popup-menus on Inventory and Contents tab panels.
<br/>Noteditor in Swing added for MOO text objects.
<br/>Few small bugs fixed.
<br/>21/11/1998 JavaMOO Alpha 4:
<br/>- Features added/Bugs fixed:
<br/>You can now change your avatar-type in the &quot;me&quot; panel.
<br/>The client does not crash now when loading bad VRML97 scenes,
<br/>in fact there are error messages in 3D ;)
<br/>Various compatibility issues solved involving smooth transfer of
<br/>info between the Java3D scene-graph and the standard browser based
<br/>VRML97 scene-graph when using multi-user services.
<br/>Lots of other bug fixes.
<br/>13/11/1998 JavaMOO Alpha 3:
<br/>Features added:
<br/>-DeepMatrix support
<br/>You can now connect MOO rooms and objects to DeepMatrix MU servers.
<br/>There is currently only support for object/avatar position, rotation and chat.
<br/>This is the 3rd VRML MU standard that JavaMOO supports in addition to VNet and IP-Multicast.
<br/>-Viewpoint changer
<br/>Use Swing in the me panel to change your viewpoint.
<br/>06/11/1998 JavaMOO Alpha 2:
<br/>Features added:
<br/>-VNet support
<br/>You can now connect MOO rooms and objects to VNet servers.
<br/>For example, you can do: @move me to #237
<br/>This will teleport you to the vrmLab Town Square and you can
<br/>meet/chat with other users/avatars even if they are not running
<br/>Java3D but the NS/IE/Cosmo/VW/VNetClient combo.
<br/>-Me panel
<br/>Now you can adjust your headlight volume, scale your avatar and
<br/>change your gender using the JavaMOO Swing GUI ;)
<br/>-Keyboard arrow keys for 3D movement left+right/forward+back.
<br/>You can change those keyboard shortcuts easily by hacking the
<br/>KeyboardBehavior.java file and recompile it.
<br/>21/10/1998 JavaMOO Alpha 1:
<br/>This is primarily a Moo client using VRML97, HTML and/or Flash to
<br/>describe how Moo objects look like. We intend to use this system
<br/>for developing multi-user role-playing games and educational
<br/>applications for the Internet.

<br/>History
<br/>JavaMoo was born on 1. April 1998 as an Java applet to work in a
<br/>(HTML) Browser with a VRML plugin and using the VNet multi-user
<br/>avatar system. Next JavaMoo evolved into using Flash applets to
<br/>describe the Moo spaces in a cartoon like fashion. Now after attending
<br/>(remotely) a Java3D presentation @ the VRML LA User Group - I decided
<br/>to make an Java3D version, and here it is.

 title : The LibLearn Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This library is allowing applications like LingoTeach and MajorTeach to remember what the User&#39;s brain has retained.
<br/>LibLearn notes all the Users Exposures to every piece of Information. It also notes all the Challanges the User has been exposed to and notes if the User has answered correctly.
<br/>All this information is stored in an XML file in the User&#39;s home directory, or, depending on how liblearn is compiled, in a Postgres Database that is residing on a Server. That&#39;s great for schools, since grading is can be done directly on what the student knows, cutting out Test Performance.
<br/>After collecting all this information, LibLearn allows the Application to show an &quot;interesting and important&quot; snippet of Information. It will, if used daily, repeat the appropriate information, first once per hour, then, once per day, every second day , every 4th day, once a week, every second week, then once a Month, and again 2 Months later. At that point, the knowledge should have been well absorbed inside the User&#39;s brain.
<br/>There may also be an application that allows the User to set preferences on how exactly this should work.
<br/>Also, liblearn may eventually try to get smart and try to optimize the learning intervals using statistical techniques.</p>

GNU Guile (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) and the SDOM (http://www.nongnu.org/sdom/) Scheme module are used as the &quot;glue&quot; that manages user input and event handling. An application programmer passes an XML document (including, potentially, a set of CSS stylesheets) and an Ncurses WINDOW structure, and libRUIN paints the WINDOW according to the markup and CSS; the programmer may subsequently pass Ncurses-style input strings to that WINDOW via libRUIN, and libRUIN will handle the resulting event flows.</p>
