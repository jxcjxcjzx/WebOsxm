 title : The Dynamic Extensible Styles Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>With browser support for Cascading-Style Sheets(CSS) dramatically increasing in the past few years the use of styles in web pages has also dramatically increased. Even though the use of CSS does provide much needed flexibility to web programmers it is still limited and somewhat error prone. A limitation that has effected may developers is its lack of relationships with other elements. For example if you have a style and would like to base other styles on that, it is not possible and there is no easy mechanism to implement this. A framework is needed that will allow developers to create styles and allow other styles to be “derived” from these. If a change is made in the base style then these changes should propagate throughout the “children” of this style. This is exactly what Dynamic Extensible Styles(DES) provides.
<br/>Even though CSS does have a property called “inheritance”, it is certainly not inheritance in the sense that Object-Oriented programmers are used to. On many occasions I have encountered the problem that many styles were based on a single style, then that (base) style needed to be changed. The solution was to find all styles based on it and update those, manually. In these situations the search/replace feature in IDE’s have been invaluable. As style use continues to grow the frequency for this problem to arise will indeed grow as well. Using DES a change can update any number of styles automatically without looking for a single style that has been based on the changed style.</p>

 title : The SheepAsleep Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>I intend to create various neural networks that will help categorize poems after their authors. In the first phase I’m going to use letter patterns to do that, as per a paper by Johan F. Hoorn, Stefan L. Frank, Wojtek Kowalczyk and Floor Van Der Ham. Unlike in their research, I want to use self organizing maps, not supervised feed-forward networks. 
<br/>In a second phase, I’ll replace the letter combination input with some NLP analysis, though exactly how I still have to document myself.</p>

<p>Practical purposes of this application would be to categorize popular poems (creations with multiple authors - folklore), to help in settling authorship disputes etc. In future, I want to expand this to prose and even music.</p>

<p>The development will be done in Java 5.</p>

<br/>To understed treelayer project idea, I need to speak about some things.
<br/>Has 2 years, Mentor project was created with only one objective: test technologies.
<br/>Hibernate, EJB, RMI, Swing and so has been tested. After some time, Mentor was fragmented, particulary in DTOptimzer. DTOpmizer walk to a important Enterprise plugin, runnig very fine with Struts, JSF, Swing and EJB and Hibernate tools.
<br/>After to this, with my master thesis, the Merlin project was created, to produce user interfaces with new approach, without any line of code. The Merlin are incipient, but very much work in teorical area has being made.
<br/>So, to join these ideas, we need a &quot;central project&quot;, that conglomerate documentation, diagrams, meetings archives, mailists and every related documentation and ideas.
<br/>I hope that treelayer project will be approved :)</p>

 title : The Wrap Look And Feel Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>J2SE 2 1.4.2 does not offer a way to globally turn anti aliasing
<br/>  on with Swing components. This has been discussed many times and lot of people
<br/>  want to be able to turn
<br/>  AA in their application. J2SE 5 makes it possible as explained here and here. However
<br/>  this does not appear to be as an official API, it makes use of a class in com.sun.java.swing which
<br/>  has the comment &quot;You should not rely on this class even existing&quot;,
<br/>  finally the Request For Enhancement (RFE) asking for the ability to globally
<br/>  turn anti aliasing on is still
<br/>  opened.  </p>

<p>Anyway, let&#39;s say the issue is solved with J2SE 5. What about
<br/>  applications running with J2SE 2? Will they benefit from an update with this
<br/>  new (hidden) functionality?
<br/>This project is an attempt to provide one more solution to
<br/>  this issue.
<br/>The origins of the project are detailed in this article.</p>

 title : The Stribog the attitude sensing platform Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>Stribog will implement a platform for measuring user orientation relative to sides of world: azimuth, pitch and roll. the hardware includes a 3-axis magnetoresistive compass, a tilt sensor based on accelerometer ICs and a microcontroller to manage all.
<br/>The project consists of hardware and software sections, both under the GPL.
<br/>The hardware section includes all information needed for reproducing the system, i.e. schematics, boards layout in the form that most board manufacturers accept and so on. this is implemented using GPLd packages gEDA (http://www.geda.seul.org/) and pcb (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcb).
<br/>The hardware is based on Honeywell magnetoresistive sensors, the most precise relatively low-cost magnetic sensors, Analog Devices MMIC accelerometers and optionally Analog Devices angular rate sensors. the microcontroller is a Philips ARM-based LPC2138. all these are expected to show about 1-degree precision.
<br/>It is also planned to use the platform motion data obtained from a GPS sensor.
<br/>The software will include uC program, which should solve necessary navigation tasks, and utilities to connect to GNU/Linux PC host. most likely the uC part will run without any OS. currently it uses only one external library (libgcc.a). stribog software is written in C and translated with GNU tools.
<br/>Auxiliary boards base on AVR microcontrollers. the programs running
<br/>on them are developped with AVR-libc/GCC/Binutils toolchain.
<br/>Other Software Required:
<br/>------------------------
<br/>gnu binutils (http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/)
<br/>gcc (http://gcc.gnu.org)
<br/>gEDA (http://www.geda.seul.org/)

 title : The Tensors Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>This library may be used to code tensorial equations using Gibbs (direct) notation. It is not very efficient because of temporary objects. However, besides it is very easy to use, any dimension may be selected. Likewise, tensors with higher orders (5, 6, etc.) may be easily added to the library. Operators are defined for dot, double-dot and dyadics (including Professor Brannon&#39;s &quot;leaf&quot; and &quot;palm&quot; dyadics). It is possible, for example, to do simulations using complex numbers in a four dimension space.</p>

If you have a text written in two languages, and the two languages are not two big blocks, it&#39;s desirable to have a tool to detect in what language each piece of the text was written and spell check accordingly. Currently, as far as I know, the most capable free software text processors can spell check multilingual texts, but they can&#39;t guess in what language the text was written. Bispell is useful, for example, if your text is written in one language but with many quotations in another language.</p>

 title : The XML Schema Best Practices Checker Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>XML is becoming the standard way to exchange information between different applications. Increasingly more businesses will do data exchange with their partners on the Web using XML technology. 
<br/>	The success of XML based data exchange depends on ability of both sides of communication channel to process XML messages unambiguously . WSDL and XML Schema specification in general are subject to interpretation by multiple third parties. 	Certain schema features are not supported, or not supported consistently, by commonly available third party XML processing and development tools. If such features are used in a schema design, the generated XML messages by one vendor&#39;s software will not be processed consistently by receiving parties utilizing another vendor&#39;s XML processing software. As a result unexpected results or communication failures are possible. The logical solution to this problem is to use only XML Schema features commonly supported by all major XML processing tools. The goal of this project was to develop an extensible software framework for validating a given XML Schema or WSDL document against a set of the XML Schema best practices formulated at AT&amp;T.</p>
