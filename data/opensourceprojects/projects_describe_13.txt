 title : The Fatima Blog / Podcast Software Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>JavaPress: Java Blogging / Content Management System</p>

<p>This software is a content management system that runs in a Jakarta Tomcat container with AJAX additions.</p>

<p> Because it runs in Java, it provides a good alternative to the many PHP containers out there. From the technology perspective, it has custom category management, and category exclusion like Slashdot, Rome 0.5 API(s) from Sun Microsystems provides RSS 2.0, 1.x, and Atom x.3 feeds as well as auto generating feeds for each category and can generate Podcasts using the tag. It also has automated XML-RPC pinging using Apache&#39;s XML-RPC libraries and can ping up to 50 sites with custom categories (i.e. you can ping javablogs.com with only your &quot;Java&quot; category RSS feed if you wish). It also has a complete user management area where users can edit or delete their comments and manage their information, something lacking in other blogging software. It also includes internal messaging and email notification using JavaMail. It has a custom admin section as well to manage all aspects of the code, and can run on MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any XML JDBC interface using connection pooling. It also uses Hibernate for many Java Beans.</p>

<p>The project is delivered in two sections:</p>

<p>PressCore -  The EAR file, although it can be simply deployed as classes in the WEB-INF/classes folder, contains all the workhorse code, including the Technorati integration, Hibernate code, Connection Pooling, JNDI, category management and exclusion, rss generation, podcasting manager, xml-rpc pinging (up to 40 sites now, database driven!) and many other neat things.</p>

<p>PressWeb - The WAR file as it were, or simply the content with the JSP tags and example WEB-INF and META-INF that implements all the db pooling, mailing and other features. Should be easy to set up if you use the /install directory after you deploy this WAR in your Tomcat container (WARNING: Delete this install directory before you release in to production!)</p>

<p>External API(s):</p>

<p>Sun Microsystem&#39;s Rome 0.6 for RSS / Atom feed generation
<br/>Apache XML-RPC libraries for weblog pinging

 title : The NETLog Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>NETLog is just another logging library for .NET. I wrote it primarily because log4net wouldn&#39;t compile with DotGNU and I don&#39;t want to use Mono for several reasons.
<br/>However, this one works with DotGNU, Mono and MS .NET.
<br/>In my opinion, the design of log4net is not very straightforward or modular. I guess this is a design decision, so I actually decided to create a new logging framework. I tried to resolve this issues with my own logging library (apart from just needing a working framework).
<br/>Known differences to log4net:
<br/>- NETLog uses its method Logger.Log() for every logging event. There are no methods like Logger.Error() or Logger.Info().
<br/>- NETLog&#39;s design is modular, which means you can very easily add and use new appenders, levels or layouts (log4net terminology) in your projects.
<br/>- priorities are based on type double - to create your own priority hierarchy, just use a priority between existing ones
<br/>- no inheritance of existing loggers - however there&#39;s a slightly buggy method InheritFrom() which actually clones a logger and gives it a new name
<br/>- NETLog works with DotGNU. :)
<br/>Known similarities to log4net:
<br/>- completely configurable through xml
<br/>- loggers can have several appenders which can have custom layouts and levels
<br/>- appenders can write to whatever you want them to - currently built in are FileAppender and ConsoleAppender
<br/>- loggers can be categorized by class types</p>

 title : The Marmot Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The project marmot comes from the need to deal with the tedious task of creating classes with accessor (set_/get_/add_/push_) functions, and converting such dataclasses into XML files.
<br/>Working with XML, one must always consider the complexity/speed tradeoff. Developpement of the code handling the data leaves us with few choices, we usually decide to go with the xerces implementation but we would chose something else if we weren&#39;t trying to have the fastest way to write our classes into files.
<br/>But writing isn&#39;t our only concern, we also have to read the data back into our data structures. This work is very repetitive/boring, and looks like it could be easily automated...
<br/>The idea of Marmot is born.
<br/>Alot of other ideas came with the handling of such data, like multiple target languages and multiple toolkits for the backend of the project.</p>

 title : The TONG Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>TONG is a desceptively simple-looking game that combines the popular and oft-cloned games Tetris and Pong played in the same space at the same time. Pong paddles surround some or all sides of a tetris playfield, and all the action happens within. The main attration, however, is the customizable set of rules that explain how tetris and pong elements interact. For example, when the game starts, if a pong ball collides with a tetrad, it might bounce off, rotate the tetrad, and increase your score. Later, after a few random- or time-based rule changes (which, according to themselves, might be prominently displayed or completely secret) the ball would stick to the tetrad, changing its shape, and have a negative effect on the player&#39;s score. Constantly mixing up the chemistry between tetris and pong elements (Does the ball break away the stack at the bottom? Upon impact, does the ball split in two and the tetrad get instantly pushed down?) is the key feature of the game, and what sets it apart from other spin-offs. Two main versions will be developed (and any others that people may create building off of these) - a single-player game meant to be played primarily on a desktop computer, and a side-by-side four-player game suitable for arcade-type booths or game consoles.</p>
