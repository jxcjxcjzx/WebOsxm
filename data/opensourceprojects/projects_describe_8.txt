 title : The VI Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>The vi editor is one of the most common text editors on Unix. It was developed starting around 1976 by Bill Joy at UCB, who was tired of the ed editor. But since he used ed as a code base, access to the original sources has required a commercial Unix Source Code License for more than twenty years. In January 2002, Caldera was so kind to remove usage restrictions to the Ancient Unix Code by a BSD-style license (see the announcement at Slashdot) and thus vi is now finally free.</p>

<p>Compared to most of its many clones, the traditional vi is a rather small program (the binary size is approximately 160 kBytes on i386) just with its extremely powerful editing interface, but lacking fancy features like multiple undo, multiple screens, or syntax highlighting.</p>

<p>This port of vi has generally preserved</p>

 title : The Muddleftpd Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FTP servers tend to always want root access to do even the most basic
<br/>stuff. This ftp server was designed to overcome this limit without
<br/>limiting the access protection and safety of a regular ftp server.
<br/>This ftp server can operate as a replacement for wu-ftpd, or it can
<br/>operate under a single uid, running without any knowledge of the system
<br/>password file. Anonymous access is availible too and you can actualy create
<br/>as many guest accounts you like with same or different properties.
<br/>To do this, it has full access settings per user. You can give permissions
<br/>for particular directories or files.
<br/>This server is also secure without being overly intrusive. Unlike wu-ftpd
<br/>and many others, it doesn&#39;t do a chroot anywhere. It manages directories
<br/>internally in a secure and fast way. This means the server doesn&#39;t need to
<br/>run as root. Also since it doesn&#39;t ever run external programs, if the server
<br/>does crash, the user won&#39;t be given any privliged access.</p>

 title : The The Fat Controller Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>*
<br/>*
<br/>The FatController is an enterprise system administration tool. It aims to provide an easy way to manage, administer and monitor groups of applications/hosts/appliances. The main interface is CLI, and a GUI is planned. The CLI supports aliasing, substitution and simple scripting - It is useful but simple (The ideal solution may be to enable scripting by exposing the pyhton interpreter). FC supports periodic execution of commands, data collection for later analysis, and alert generation. Long term goals would be change tracking and generation of dynamic system documentation, along with a strongly secure methodology of operation.
<br/>I am hoping that people will find the basic idea solid and useful. Then, I hope the first steps on the project to be pulling apart what I have built, and reimplementing to a better model with appropriate technologies, with stronger defined goals and a clearer strategy to achieving them. What I have so far is a usable proof-of-concept in 6500 lines of python - I use Fatcontroller in the workplace every day to manage AIX/HP-UX/Solaris servers, TSM ( http://tsmwiki.com/tsmwiki ) servers, TELNET sessions &amp; SAN switches. FatController currently has two installations out in the wild, monitoring TSM systems and windows servers / services.
<br/>There is a Wiki which is mainly an incomplete manual;

<br/>Key Features;
<br/>LOCAL, representing the local machine
<br/>TELNET, representing any telnet session

 title : The Development Kit Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>DevelKit Framework
<br/>DevelKit Framework is an GNUstep/Cocoa framework with tools for reading, understanding and generating source code from other applications.
<br/>It&#39;s goal is to allow applications to generate code from other than textual representation, such as diagrams or other ways of description.
<br/>Implemented Features:
<br/>- ObjectiveC source reader
<br/>- ObjectiveC source generator
<br/>- project builder
<br/>- &#39;Class&#39; structure related classes (class, method, instance variable)
<br/>- source file templates
<br/>- dkautogen tool that automatically generates accessor (getter ad setter), dealloc and archiving methods (interface and implementation) for given class
<br/>Future features:
<br/>- compiler tool (gcc) wrapper class
<br/>- make tool wrapper class
<br/>- gcc error handling
<br/>This framework can be used in applications which want to create their own projects (bundles/modules) in easy way. Idea behind this is, that user is not writing makefile and source files, just some chunks of code. Framework and application will create source files and makefile. User do es not have to know about existence of some project or about some compilation taking place.</p>

Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server.
<br/>The duplicity package also includes the rdiffdir utility. Rdiffdir is an extension of librsync&#39;s rdiff to directories---it can be used to produce signatures and deltas of directories as well as regular files. These signatures and deltas are in GNU tar format.</p>

<p>Multi domain repository layout
<br/>Integrated user management

 title : The The FreeType Project Open Source Project on Open Hub
 summary : <p>FreeType 2 is a software font engine that is designed to be small,
<br/>efficient, highly customizable and portable while capable of
<br/>producing high-quality output (glyph images). It can be used in
<br/>graphics libraries, display servers, font conversion tools, text
<br/>image generation tools, and many other products as well.
<br/>Note that FreeType 2 is a font service and doesn&#39;t provide APIs to
<br/>perform higher-level features, like text layout or graphics
<br/>processing (e.g., colored text rendering, &quot;hollowing&quot;, etc.).
<br/>However, it greatly simplifies these tasks by providing a simple,
<br/>easy to use and uniform interface to access the content of font
<br/>files.
<br/>FreeType 2 is released under two open-source licenses: our own
<br/>BSD-like FreeType License and the GPL.</p>
