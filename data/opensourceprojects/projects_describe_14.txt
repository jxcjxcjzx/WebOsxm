 summary : <p>Message from the owner(s)</p>

<p>09/04/2005
<br/>After considering for a while, binary release of AlgebraicMath is now available for those who just want to use it directly.
<br/>08/04/2005
<br/>Got a really nice anagram that describes the basic concept of AlgebraicMath architecture:
<br/>AlgebraicMath &amp;minus; I Match Algebra!</p>

<p>07/04/2005
<br/>After reading about the withdrawn of JSR 108: Units Specification, feeling a bit sorry for it - and feeling the urge to implement such a power feature that is important to most of us....
<br/>Added AlgebraicMath.Dimensional - a package that would enable computation of physical quantities with units. At the moment it only has the 7 basic SI units (contained in AlgebraicMath.Dimensional.SI), but additional units and conversion rules can be put in with ease thanks to the flexible architecture of AlgebraicMath.
<br/>The new feature is tested with evaluation of the ContentType.Text Expression of (((((1+2)*3)@(&quot;A&quot;*&quot;m&quot;))*2)+((7@&quot;A&quot;)*(8@&quot;m&quot;))) (Yes I know it looks really unpleasant at the moment - Justin would be improving the text parse format soon), which result in the following Proof:</p>

<p>If you have some units in mind that you would like AlgebraicMath.Dimensional to have, just come round and leave us a message in our forum!</p>

<p>30/03/2005
<br/>Textual parsing tested and utilised in Algebra. Feel free to try out the demo provided by that project to get a feeling of the basic functionalities that AlgebraicMath can bring about!
<br/>CVS is now updated with the latest source code &amp; binary release.</p>

<p>23/03/2005
<br/>Tuned and improved the functionalities of the Parser Engine. In addition, fixed the Parser format for ContentType.Text so expressions like &quot;((S_0)||(S_1))&amp;&amp;(S_2)&quot;, &quot;(123)*(4553)&quot; etc can now be parsed as Expression&#39;s instead of sticking to the lengthy MathML codes all the time.
<br/>One thing though - after finishing the final testing on the plain text parsing format, I fully appreciate the ease of development XML provides - for those who are not convinced, compare the following regular expressions:</p>

<p>Pattern of
<br/>with MathML
<br/>with Text</p>

<p>ArbitraryConstant
<br/>&amp;lt;ci type=arbitrary-constant&gt;A&amp;lt;&amp;lt;ID&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;/ci&gt;
<br/>(?&amp;lt;![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])a_(\\w+)(?![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])</p>

<p>Constant
<br/>&amp;lt;ci type=constant&gt;C&amp;lt;&amp;lt;ID&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;/ci&gt;
<br/>(?&amp;lt;![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])c_(\\w+)(?![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])</p>

<p>Variable
<br/>&amp;lt;ci type=variable&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;name&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;/ci&gt;
<br/>(?&amp;lt;![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])([a-z]\\w*)(?![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])</p>

<p>ArbitraryStatement
<br/>&amp;lt;ci type=arbitrary-statement&amp;gt;S&amp;lt;&amp;lt;ID&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ci&amp;gt;
<br/>(?&amp;lt;![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])S_(\\w+)(?![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])</p>

<p>StatementLetter
<br/>&amp;lt;ci type=statement&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ci&amp;gt;
<br/>(?&amp;lt;![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])([A-Z]\\w*)(?![\\.\\w[^\\p{Graph}]])</p>

<p>18/03/2005
<br/>Just find out one silly fact - tests run on BlueJ are much slower than those run in NetBeans! (possibly due to the debugging routines and all that)
<br/>The 40-second proof that ran on BlueJ actually took less than 5 seconds when being tested on NetBeans - so as for basic arthimetics, AlgebraicMath has already reached real-time performance (as for the 10-second proof shown some time ago, the &quot;exact&quot; timing should be ~1s) and hence I shall spend more time on developments of other parts (cluster, libraries etc.)
<br/>Have a good Easter everyone!</p>

<p>15/03/2005
<br/>AlgebraicMath.Attribute package introduced with Special and Statement attributes at the moment; this is to utilise class hierarchy structure in java for &quot;type checking&quot; hence would potentially speed up operations like Pattern Matching which relies on such features.
<br/>In addition, the Axiom class is tuned so that one may now passes an existing Collection for the transformation methods to fill in one by one even during their process of execution; this vastly reduced the problems caused by slow Axioms holding onto partial (yet potentially useful) results during an evaluation process. Tests verified that there is at least 40% speed improvement for AlgebraicMath.Runtime.Evaluator!</p>

<p>13/03/2005
<br/>Simplification of  to  is performed just under a minute with the following axioms:</p>

<p>The 12-step proof produced by the Evaluator is presented here (In one VERY long line)
<br/>Which is an order of magnitude (~30 times) increase in computation speed with the same hardware settings (P4 3GHz 1GB RAM) compare to the first draft. Certainly a good sign of progress towards real-time performance.</p>

<p>11/03/2005
<br/>Documentation updated to reflect recent changes, especially for the expansion of AlgebraicMath Library</p>

<p>10/03/2005
<br/>After fixing a few bugs in the Pattern Matching Engine and lots of Library Implementations, here is the first Proof produced during a unit test by AlgebraicMath.Runtime.Evaluator:</p>

<p>A much more magnificent version can be found here. Any comments / suggestions on improvement would be appreciated.</p>

<p>03/03/2005
<br/>Documentation for AlgebraicMath is up for the current release and shall be kept up-to-date ever after.</p>

<p>02/03/2005</p>

<p>Project description updated:
<br/>AlgebraicMath brings real mathematics onto computers, so that many transcendental tasks with a mathematical flavour -</p>

<p>Proof, simplify and manipulate mathematical formulae and equations
<br/>Electronic circuit construction and optimisation
<br/>Compression engine highly scalable in time and complexity with negligible decoding cost
<br/>Analytical, real-time dynamical systems simulation
<br/>Next generation graphics engines with algorithmic efficiencies
<br/>Ultra-strength encryption algorithms</p>

<p>would become possible on a large variety of computing platforms.</p>

<p>28/02/2005
<br/>Random thought of the day :
<br/>The AlgebraicMath package should have been java.lang.Math - or the miraculously tiny java.Math package - as I am confident to say that what we have in this package has more to do with Mathematics than those existing &quot;standards&quot;!
<br/>(No offence to anyone - just as I said, a random comment =P)</p>

<p>23/02/2005
<br/>The first version of an extensible parser structure is implemented into Expression; any class that based on Expression can now access the static registerExpressionType() and addRepresentation() methods to make itself available for toString() and parse().
<br/>Current available ContentType is MathML and Text. LaTex might be a good idea, and if you agree then do sound your opinions in our forum!
<br/>Pattern matching engine is almost complete - we are now working on ways to use the engine directly so that Axiom can be eliminated from the core implementation. This has the advantage of allowing &quot;axioms&quot; to be evaluated by each other while performing the &quot;main&quot; calculations - analoguous to forming lemmas and theorems which would potentially speeds up the solution seeking process.</p>

<p>02/02/2005
<br/>Proof object introduced and tested to complete the capabilities of Expression object -</p>

<p>01/02/2005</p>

<p>After tuning, solution is now hit in less than 5 minutes (!) yet the proof still needs ~40 minutes to compute.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, the platform used to compute so far is just an ordinary PC; the multi-threaded design of Entity can allow potential evaluation on a cluster - and since the package is written in Java, the cluster can be as &quot;mixed&quot; as possible such that it can be easily built even by connecting a few computers of various OS together.</p>

<p>30/01/2005</p>

<p>Multi-threaded measure-dependant Entity class defined.
<br/>5 Axiom objects -
<br/>Associative(Addition)
<br/>Commutative(Addition)
<br/>Associative(Multiplication)
<br/>Commutative(Multiplication)
<br/>Distributive(Addition, Multiplication)
<br/>are used to perform the following simplification:
<br/>(ad + bc) + (ac + bd) --&gt; (a + b) * (c + d)</p>

<p>The solution is hit at ~30 minutes before the complete proof - consisting 2760 equivalent forms of the Expression - is reached in ~10 minutes later.</p>

<p>The project is currently under its earliest stage of development. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
