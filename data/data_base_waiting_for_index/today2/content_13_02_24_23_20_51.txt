Add Contact
The Contacts app will create a new contact and display a scene allowing the user to make edits or additions. Note that the contact is not actually created until the user presses the 'Done' option.

To do this, create a Contact object and pass it to the Contacts app, which you can launch using the Application Manager's open method.
