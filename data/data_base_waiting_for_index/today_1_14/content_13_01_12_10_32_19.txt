The W3C web standards consortium has presented a first Public Working Draft for integrating a Web Cryptography API into browsers. The JavaScript API will provide features such as hashing, key generation and verification, as well as encryption and decryption. For example, it will enable web applications to check a user's identity in more secure ways than are currently possible between browsers and HTTP servers. 

Another potential field of application is the management of the read and write privileges of encrypted documents in a cloud. The W3C also said that the Web Cryptography API will allow the communication between browsers and servers to be encrypted via other methods than SSL/TLS. 

The working draft that has just been released is an early version, and the Web Cryptography Working Group has asked for feedback and called on web developers and organisations to provide input on any open topics or missing features.
