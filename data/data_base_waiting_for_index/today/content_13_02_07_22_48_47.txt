typedef struct {
int nFrames;
int nFeatures;
KLT_Feature **feature;
} *KLT_FeatureTable;

A KLT_FeatureTable is a two-dimensional array of features with nFrames columns and nFeatures rows. It is used to collect the features tracked through an image sequence.
Data in a feature table is accessed by indexing the feature number before the frame number. For example, if ft is a feature table, the following code prints the data:

KLT_FeatureTable ft;
int feat, frame;

for (feat = 0 ; feat < ft->nFeatures ; feat++)
     for (frame = 0 ; frame < ft->nFrames ; frame++)  {
          printf("(%5.1f,%5.1f) = %d\n", 
               ft->feature[feat][frame]->x,
               ft->feature[feat][frame]->y,
               ft->feature[feat][frame]->val);
     }
